            "In this chapter, the UM uses his dialectical-metaphysical approach to define the notion of disparities. He draws a line between object-oriented thinking and self-conscious behavior by drawing a distinction between them. The difference between the subject and the substance is the division between them: the subject is the object; the substance has its own doing. The subject cannot fully grasp the substantial content of the object because it does not know how to respond to the opposing material reality. This contrasts with Christianity, where man can only attain unity with god through an effort to remove himself from material filh and ascend back to god. Disparity points toward a whole that does not fit together so that the whole appears artificially composite. It is impossible to understand why science and theology do not work together in the same way. Mao writes about women holding up half of Heaven, which means that there is great chaos beneath heaven. Marcel Prouset tells us that when he was talking to his grandmother, she subtracted her voice from the totality of his body. When he saw her, he realized that she was sick and lost in thought. At the philosophical level, truth is at the side of abstract reduction, subjection, and not upon the sideof organic totality\n",

            "In this chapter, the UM uses the analogy of a dog as an example of how Hegelian universality can be applied to human beings. He says that there are always only one species or subspecies that functions like \"a filler\" and that it is impossible to make such an affirmation anti-hegelian. He also discusses the concept of concrete universality, which means that all things exist under the same conditions. The idea of concrete universalization comes from Hegel's notion of universality in relation to other people. For instance, Ambedkar believes that there will be outcasts in India because of the social hierarchy. This contradiction arises from the fact that Hinduism did not have a system for dealing with untouchables. It was just a question about the foundation of religion. Although both men respect each other, their differences are insurmountably different. They argue that the solution to the problem by returning to the original noncorruptible system is more effective than abolishing the whole system. If one wants to break out into the children of god, it isn't enough to remove the castes from society. But if you want to change the status of humanity, it doesn't matter what kind of person you are. There are two kinds of features that are more essential: labor and speech. These are those that we use to represent our immanent desires. We don't necessarily focus on these features; they are simply shared by others. Thus, when we say that speech is more essential, we mean that it makes us communicate with others. When we say man is the animal who clips its nails, we are talking about something else. That is why many people believe that sexuality is nothing but a form of reproduction. Freud sees this as the beginning of metaphysical activity. Christianity does not view sexuality as anything specific to humans since it competes with spirituality. Christianism thinks that sexual desire is the fundamental step toward the Absolute Good. Therefore, Christians do not consider sexuality to be any sort of evil. Instead, they look at it as the ultimate step towards the absolute Good. A modern individual experiences himself as his own personal experience. He has no connection to the particular circumstances of his life. He feels self-aware of the limitations of class distinctions and cannot judge whether justice is right or wrong.\n",

            "In this chapter, Spinoza argues that the only way to understand human beings is through their lack of knowledge. He rejects the notion that we should use our ignorance to create morality and injunctions. Lacan emphasizes the From Human to Posthuman Man 21 deontic dimension of being himself. The difference between reality and the world is not just an ontological difference; it also exists as part of the illusion imagined by the master who delivers the message. It is here that we find ontological difference. This difference between the highest or true being and its second shadows is offuscatated by the differences between the supreme being and his secondary shadows: what was going to happen if you were heard what I are ordering you. We can now see two opposing tendencies within this approach towards overcoming humanism and Transhumanism. Posthumanists believe that science and technology will lead us into a posthumanistic mode of being where we will be unable to relate to the animal kingdom. These two opposed tendencies exist within this orientation toward overcoming humanity. PostHumanists argue that humans are one of the animals on Earth, but they do not refer to the transhumanist movement which has been taking place since the beginning of the twentieth century. Biogenetics have become popular among these anti-humanist groups because it dissolves frontiers between men and animals on one side and between humans and machine on the other\n",

            "In this chapter, the UM uses the analogy of transcendentality to argue that everything in the world is always overdeterminated. He rejects the idea of overdeterminations and believes that every subject can only be overdetermine by its relation to reality. The UM also defends the notion of an onticity as opposed to an ontology because it does not involve self-experimentation but rather the \"inhuman\" core of what he calls negativeity, death drives, and otherontological difference. This means that humans are excluded from all kinds of social positions; they do not fit into the universal form of human being. It is therefore important to distinguish between premodern Cartesian subjects and antihumanist subjects. Kant was the first philosopher against humanism who rejected both terms: the void of negativity and the person. For example, Heidegger's definition of being human implies that we cannot be fully human until we have our own individual selves. If we take this limitation or obstacle away, we lose ourselves. Berardi points out that the next task of science will be about harnessing the power of the brain. Brain activity is going to play a big role in the future.\n",

            "In this chapter, Wollstonecraft focuses on the Carbon Liberations Front and asks whether it is possible for humans to be alienated from shared life. Hegel responds that there are two kinds of alienation: first, we can see how difficult it is to reduce the complexity of an object to the \"essential\"; and second, we cannot understand science because it is not dependent on consciousness. The latter is true, however, because science happens in History, constrained with forms of social order. It is only through high theory that we get down to the lowest level of human experience. This means that science does not depend on human consciousness, but rather its ability to perceive the real outside of our normal reality. Morton introduces the concept of interobjective hyperobjects, which are objects that are distributed throughout time and space. These objects are phased, meaning they do not exist in any particular place or time. They become more substantial when they are seen in relation to other objects. Thus, these objects are as threat to organic matter as they are against human beings. There is also a paradox inherent in anthropocentene: society became aware of self- limitation when it became strong enough to influence the balance of all life on earth\n",

This means that Anderson does not believe in Hegel and his critics because they attack him as a \"straw man\" who has nothing to do with the actual content of his work. Anderson also dismisses the use of science as the main scientific reference since it is important to understand how human beings are created and how they relate to one another.

            "In this chapter, Lacan explains how subjectivity can be divided between appearance and the inaccessible content of its being. He uses the example of Bostoridge's novel Winterreise to illustrate his point that subjectivity is not just a matter of appearance but also an object. The object we see as subject is nothing but itself; it is only possible because subjectivity exists in its own self-portrait. This means that subjects are separate from other objects and cannot be separated from their substantial content. For example: A stranger comes to the house and does not want to marry or have children. Because there is no reason for him to leave, he is empty. It is therefore the cause of his departure. Furthermore, since the person who left the house was rejected by his parents, they are not alienated from the real world. Thus, subjectivity has two modes of functioning: one which disturbs harmony with another and one which fills in the gap between them. Since sexual relations are part of human society, there isn't any need for prosthetics. We don't have first intersubjectivities without a prothetic supplement. Therefore, our subject is \"the Other Quaternal Real Thing\" . If we were to think of anything as subjectivity, we wouldn't know what it is until we realize that it doesn't exist at all. Instead, we pass from something to something through a series of passages. From substance to subject becomes a reflective reversional process. Subjectivity is always tearing apart unity. Reason is more important than understanding because it allows us to subsume everything else. As opposed to reasoning, however, Reason is less important than Understanding because it gives us insight into what actually is happening. When we perceive something as abstract, we blind ourselves to its constituent features. That is, we do not understand what the object is really like. What makes sense here is that we view things as abstractions rather than mere notions.\n",

            "In this chapter, Bryant focuses on the idea of how we can construct our own understanding of reality. He begins by saying that it is necessary for us to defend autonomy of objects and substances, not to reduce them to their relations. This means that subject is nothing more than an inaccessible entity. Quenti Meillassouux also discusses facticity with regard to absolute contin-gency. The only way to know what is possible is through experience. It is through factsicity that we can make our way toward the absolute. For example, when we think about something as being part of another thing, it is actually self-withdrawn. When we see something as belonging to another person, we are treated as others rather than ourselves. If we were talking about God, however, we would say that God is opaque to us. Thus, all things are like Lacanian subjects: each object perceives everything as being related to another; there is no direct relation between the object and the other. Each object does not have direct access to another but instead has blind spots. Withdrawing here is the structure of objects, not an accident relation of how they relate to another object. As such, every object is withdrawn from itself. All these points lead to the question of why people do not engage in serious political action. DistitiesBryant gives two examples of communist societies: one where political jokes were really a form of resistance to the ruling ideological system, while another where the majority did not take seriously the ruling ideology. These examples illustrate how socialism fails to produce real change.\n",

            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how bureaucracies work. He describes two scenes in which a hero loses his plumbing and goes to the state repair service to get help. After the sheote is done, he sends a message for an official repair service but instead of doing the job, it takes him directly to the customer. The ultimate crime in any bureaucratic system is to simply do the job that one is expected to do. This cycle of repro creates space for the pleasure of being wasted. At the level of utilitarianism, there are many tasks that need to be accomplished; however, these tasks are not necessarily performed efficiently because they are caught in the circularity of repetition. A good bureaucrat always gets caught up in this cycle of repeating things, creating problems, and making people unhappy. For example, Martel uses the example of black slaves who recognized themselves as human rights subjects during the French Revolution. They misunderstood the point, believing that their own individual rights were intended only by whitemen of property. However, when the situation in Haiti was so strong that it could no longer be understood within its framework, the Bolshevs and Hitler adopted different versions of the communist movement. These new versions included economic crises, moral disintégration, and other nonideological disturbances. Thus, all these external perturbations had to be interpreted through an ideological frame. If we can imagine ideology as autopoetic systems, such as Russia in 1917, then what we can see from the outside world is nothing but \"the excess of theIn-itself\" . We cannot see what we don't see. Because information is predicated on prior distinctions that allow events to take on value, it follow that systems have blind spots. It follows that reality is what you do not perceive when you perceive it.\n",

            "In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the difference between reality and actuality. He uses an analogy to illustrate his point: real is not part-of-reality but a virtual thing that cannot actually be seen or experienced. It is impossible for anything to exist because it is immobilized by historical forces, such as class struggle and sexual antagonism. The only way to achieve this illusion is to use symbolic meaning. This means that we can see things in terms of other people rather than with our own perceptions. Wolstonecraft then discusses the concept of stasi, which refers to stability and immobility. A person who resists something will always have the power to resist something else. For example, when a subject protests against society, it opens up the possibility of accessing the unconscious.\n",

            "In this chapter, the UM uses Hegel's concept of experience to explain his failure in speculating on the relationship between subjects and predicates. The subject is the contradiction that forms the central of all things; it is the subject itself that resists its objectification. This contradiction also applies to Freud's idea of the unconscious as the product of dream-work. It is not simply an intention or a prediction, but rather a desire fulfilled by the work of the dreamer. Thus, the laten dream-thoughted becomes the material that the dream worker transforms into \"the manifest dream\"; the only essential thing for dreams is the labor of encodeing/masking the dream thoughts. For example, a manager may be involved in a day-dream because he wants to finance the production of a new machine. But the owner of the factory must depend upon capital to pay for the translation of the wish into the dream language. Therefore, the workers who perform the job are dependent on the capitalist to provide the necessary funds for the creation of the new device.\n",

            "Hegel argues that the only way to proceed with this argument is not to dismiss freedom and equality as false, but to fight for what freedom means. If we simply dismiss the whole world as a fake, then it will end up in communism. This is because there is no unity between the rational and the laws of nature. In other words, being evil cuts off from the universe. The Bible says that Adam and Eve should become like God by eating the fruits of the tree; after they do so, God tells them that they are like one of them. But Hegel points out that subjectivity is also evil because it makes people evil. It is the gaze that perceives evil everywhere around it. Evil is an illusion: it exclusions itself from society. Good arises when we choose good through this primordial choice. We experience the Good once, after choosing evil, we become conscious of the inadequancy of 80 discriptivesour situation. Thus, the fall is at its basic, the transition form from theinsubstantial into the substance. Life as such is neither evil nor stupid; it is more than and more. The Fall is the transition from \"the insubstantials to the substance\" . A subject cannot be split between appearance and materiality. Subject is divided between appearance-to-subject. The subject is divided among appearance and content. The object that subjects are is what Laca calls objetA a, a weird objects which is not just lacking, never completely here, always giving the subject something to look at. That is why subject is nothing but confusion. When subject is seen frontally, it acquires shape only when looking backwardly. There is a gap between reality and transcendence. All three cases have the same gap between ordinary realities and transcendent dimensions. The poet sees beauty in the face of a bush, while the madman misperces a real thing as something else. They all mistake someone for God or devil. These two examples show how subjectivity can be reduced to nothing but failure to be subject. Assuming that subject is passive, subject does not stand on active intervention. Instead, subject is self-reliant.\n",

Kant uses the term epigenesis as an example: epigenesis is \"the encounter of contingent things in experience, who actualize the transcendentally network.\" The subject becomes transcendental when it experiences its own self-inventment. This freedom allows subjectivity to act independently. If we were to enter the realm of the sublime, then we would deprove ourselves into lifeless automation or thinking machines. Hegel defends this idea by saying that we are only at the level where our actions are determined by the logic of pleasure and pain. We are reduced to mere mechanism. It is impossible for us to return to the infinite world through our actions.\n",

            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how different objects can be represented in relation to one another. He uses an example of observing a dog that does not do anything in the nighttime. The absence of such something can then be used as a source of self-reflection. This is important because it allows us to talk about what we don't see or experience at all. For instance, if there is no penis in the house, then presence can arise only against its background. If there is nothing else in the room, then our presence can also arise against the fact that there is none. Thus, when someone lacks a signifying field, they have to use a symbol that has no meaning. Lévin-Strausses first introduces the concept of mana into his philosophy. Mana is a zero-signifyer, which represents nothing more than \"that floating signifier\" which is the handicap of all fimini thought. It is here that Brandom starts his reading of phenomenological theory with an understanding of experience. Hegel says that when we compare our idea of / object to this thing ourselves, we change our notion and become conscious of what it is. When we alter our notion, however, things are changed. We now know that the stick itself is bent, but instead of being bent, it is actually straight. What changes is the way we perceive the stick for us. Our perception of the stick is altered by our new notion of it. And so on. These three levels of experience are essential for knowledge: 1) we understand the stick; 2) we recognize it as real; and 3) we realize that it is really in itself. So what happens after we discover these contradictions is that we begin to discard them.\n",

            "In this chapter, the UM uses the example of an unfortunate stick as an example of how contradiction can be resolved by thinking about it. He rejects the notion that what is outwardly inconsistent is not the world itself but rather the essence of reason. The difference between objects that appear to be self-conscious and those that are not, he says, is that they do not exist in the same way. For instance, when we see a self-consciously conscious stick, we realize that it is part of the real world because it exists for us. When we see something that is completely self-confident, we know that it means something else. We also learn that there are other kinds of self-contradictions that cannot be resolved through epistemologies. These are called epistimological illusions or inadequacies. Hegel does not reconcile the two sides of reality with each other; instead, if we want to reconcile, we must change our perception of reality so that we can understand it better.\n",

            "The narrator uses the example of the 1920s collectivation of land as an example of Hegel's immobilism. He says that everything is already there, and that this immanent contradictory action is what Lebrunch calls \"immobilisment.\" This is why Lebrun calls it immobilisticm: things become what their always-always were, not what they are today, but what they always have been. In order for these things to really change, they first have to accept that they exist in the past. For example, when a bell Button is connected to another bomb, one can only press it with the intent of doing something important. When he presses it, however, his actions are nothing more than mere impulses. If he wants to visit someone else, he does not need to be responsible for the consequences; he just needs to act on behalf of the common good. Hegelian theory emphasizes the unity of creation and finding within individuals engaged in specific actions. Thus, each individual acts according to his or her own desires and needs. There is absolutely no higher idea which governs the relationship between the initial goal and its transformation through corrections. It is impossible to reconcile objective normative structure with actuality because all people engage in them. Therefore, alienation exists only through the interaction of individuals who are involved in those structures.\n",

The idea here is that we are going to live in a world where everything is already done before it happens. This means that we have to take ourselves to being already free. If you want to get rid of your military service, you must do it as if nothing has happened. But if you want something more permanent, you need to break down the old order first. It doesn't matter what kind of revolution you go through; it only matters whether or not you actually change it. For example, if everyone thinks that the world is already dead, then they can just act as though everything has already happened. That way, when things don't work out, they won't be wasting time trying to figure out how to keep them from falling apart. So, there are two kinds of breaks: 1) formal breaks at the beginning and 2) formal breaks after the fact--the first opens up the actual process of change, while the second occurs at the final moment. These two processes are different because they involve both forms of change. The first form takes note of what has already been done, but the second acts take note of all that has already taken place. Everyone who wants to change needs to realize that their whole world is now lost. They also need to register the fact that these changes are already done so that no one ever loses his or her chance to become a better person. Finally, however, even when the battle ends, the loss of the old system becomes effective.\n",

            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how we can never reconcile ourselves to the past. He believes that there is no way for us to reach full reconciliation because of the gap between our actions and the consequences of them. We cannot ever get rid of these gaps in our lives; they are only constitutive. Each moment we build recollations which reconcile us with history, but no story is finally final. The goal of all such stories is to find out how things have changed. This means that each time we remember something, it will be different from what we already know. It also means that every time we think about something again, it becomes retroactive. For example, when Bergman tells his wife that she will leave Casablanca soon, people don't know until after the last day of shooting at the ending. They assume that one of their male partners will die or go away with her husband. But once the end comes, it appears as the only natural ending.\n",

            "In this chapter, the UM uses the analogy between God and the community of followers to explain why it is necessary for a religious community to exist. The first problem is that there are already Jewish religions that focus on life after death or on the inner belief in God. This is because Jews have already practiced such a system: they live according to the rules of their society. They do not believe in God but instead worship him as an immanent substance. Therefore, the only difference between the two religions is that they don't say much about life after dead or about the inner beliefs in God; rather, they just obey the communal rules. It is important to note that these practices are different from those of Christianity. For example, Judeaism does not say anything about living after death nor about the Inner Belief in God, while Christian religion emphasizes obedience to the communal rule. He also says that God is still alive in the community even though it doesn't explicitly say what kind of life it will lead. So how can we reconcile this relationship between necessity/contingency? First, let's look at the relationship between self-organizing contingency and subjectivity. Self-organization has to be based on self-reproduction so that one can see things as being real. Once something becomes real, however, it cannot be posited into reality by its own presumption. Thus, human subjects become subject to Christ, who is the object of all human activity. As Christians, God becomes aware of himself through Christ. If you want to know more about Jesus, go read his book, The Holy Spirit And Mankind.\n",

            "Pippin defends Hegel's principle of self-consistency, freedom, and reason in this paper. He argues that it is necessary for humans to be conscious of their actions because they are capable of justifying them with reasons. This means that they can act freely without fear of being judged by others. Pippn also argues against the notion of an object as a self; rather, he believes that only subjectivity can achieve this goal. In contrast, Kristeva emphasizes the abjectness of things as the foundation of subjectivity: \"the defining feature was for him selfconsciousness\" . The idea of something as belonging to another thing does not mean that it belongs to someone else. It means that there is no separation between what is real and what is not. Self-consciously aware subjects have the ability to distinguish between how things are and how they appear to each other. Thus, one cannot simply assert or just act without knowing why. Therefore, we must know why our actions are being taken. Pipin furthermore discusses Hegelian theories about self-reflection and reflection. He claims that these two kinds of reflection are independent of one another.\n",

            "In this chapter, Hegel focuses on the concept of self-reversal and how it can be used to explain what is going on in the world. He uses examples from the classical literature as an example. A subject cannot achieve its full identity when it does not fully grasp the substantial content of the object being observed. The believer's experience of becoming abandoned by God becomes a gap between God and himself that separates him from God. Pippin also discusses the idea of absolute reflection, which means that everything is always relative to itself but only externally. Hegelian terms are absoluter Gegensetzen, or counterpunch, which refers to the effect of losing something upon itself. This implies that we do not lose our own sense of ourselves because there is no way for us to get rid of these things. We have no access to the profound presubjectative Real, so we cannot get rid off it. Absoluter Ausgangsstoß stands for the coincidence of the opposings in the action. What is found only come to be until being left behind is the result of its own absence. It is the retroactivity of its loss. Self-consciousness is one of the most important subjects in psychoanalysis. Lacan de-substantizes the unconscious into the more modern field of subjectivity. He considers the state as the self-consciously ethical substance of a person.\n",

            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how Hegel's theory of self-reflection works in relation to his theory of reason. He uses an analogy of earthquakes to illustrate how the concept of the unconscious can be used to describe the inner turmoil that characterizes all human beings. This is because the unconscious is not necessarily dominated by the external world, but rather its epicentre: the \"deep hypocentre\" of human experience. For example, George Kaplan has a name attached to him as a spy for the CIA. The idea of having a secret identity makes him vulnerable to foreigners and other dangers. Art and religion have a long history reaching down into Hegelian territory, but they are still separate from one another. Hegel believes that art cannot exist without the spirit; it must also exist within itself.\n",

            "Hegel's greatest failure in art is not that he can see the infinite goal already realized. The illusion of reconciliation is ultimately the reconciliation with failure itself. Pippin thinks this is what modern artists like Manet, Cezanne, and Picasso all do. In fact, they indicate alienation from society as individuals lack proper place within it. They are forced to position themselves as an independent subject without any means of identity or projecting into the artwork. This creates a sense of disorientation among the spectators. For example, in his Luncheon On the grass, he describes two naked women engaged in postcoital cleaning. Their nakedness indicates tender shame while the naked woman sits on the grass looking but not seeing. All the social divisions invade the painting; there is no source of light inside the painting. It is also apparent that the ugly gaze is one of the most powerful features of art. Art makes every shape in each member some specific activity and partial emotions. But for instance, when we look at the thousand-eyed Argus by Holbein, our eyes signal castration. When we stare at the image of thousands of eyes, however, our soul becomes visible. We cannot understand why many eyes are present in such a picture. If we ask why these eyes are so important, Freudian philosophers say that they are only used to signal castingration of the one. And then again, because of class distinctions, people return in multiplicity. There is nothing new about the Black Athena thesis.\n",

The idea of self-consciousness in sculptures is absent from most works because they do not express the inner self as it is expressed in the form of the eye. Instead, these works are more like an expression of spirituality than anything else. For example, Christ's body was distorted by his own appearance, making him visible to the world as a human being. Both Judasm and Christianity believe that God lives in \"an unrepresentible realm,\" separated from humans by an absolute gap between them. From the sublime to the monstaus, Rosenkrrenz introduces the concept of the ugly as an object of aesthetic art. He uses the term \"ugliness\" to refer to the fact that something can be ugly even though it is beautiful. This means that one can have both good and bad qualities at the same time.\n",

It becomes inorganic and loses its vitality. Life is disgusting at the way it got there. There are some really sublime moments in Ridley Scotsman's Alienrection: One of the first is when Ripley goes to the laboratory room where the aborted versions of herself are on display. She sees them but doesn't get rid of them. The second is when she finds a piece of paper on the floor next to her body. This is like a message from the other scene. Hitchcock takes great pleasure in cleaning the bathroom after his work. He thinks about how perfect an act can be for evil purposes. He also considers how morally inappropriate it is for Hegelian art to claim that it is beautiful. Hegel does not yet understand the ways in which abstract art works.\n",

            "In this chapter, the narrator discusses the various forms of literature that confront and sublimate abjectness. The most famous is Céline's \"long voyage to the Bottom of the Night,\" in which he describes the night as the night of an abject. He also warns against any attempt to escape from the patriarchical order by returning to the pre-Protectional female rhythm of drives. This is because it leads us into anti-Samitism. For example, three decades ago German nationalist leaders printed an advertisement with the slogan: Kärnten bleiben deutsch. These words were used on newspapers throughout Austria during the 1897-1897 campaign against the Slovene Threat. Since these people did not want to be associated with anything other than the word for Beetle, Freud wrote up a series of references to the meaning of Käfer when he was attempting to catch his first black beeletle at age ten. When he heard this phrase, he laughed loudly and explained that the meaning had come from being unable or unable to create one's mind. Thus, we can see how Kristeva uses the term \"abjection\" to refer to all kinds of situations. She does not understand what she calls the symbolic order; she thinks only of the abjection itself. Her definition of the symbolic order comes from her understanding of the semiotic. She believes that every call to return back to the Judeo Christian Compound has repressed something else within it. It is therefore necessary for the Jew to avoid the conflict between working class/capital and the separation between the symbolic and real.\n",

            "The narrator uses the example of Freud to explain how his rejection of an \"inassimilably joussance\" can lead to barbarism, which is what causes people to reject their own identities. In this way, Lacan sees himself as a group of people who reject the other's jibes. He does not know who or why he is, but he recognizes himself among others who have rejected it. This makes him defend himself against anti-Jewism. For example, in 1931, Adolph Hitler said that they had to kill the Jewish leader within us. Because Jews are the object of the Gentlelies, and because they are so flexible, they need the Jew in order to keep their identity. Anti-Racialism is always historical phenomena, even if its internal form changes with each historical rupture. As for Kristeva's theory of semiotics, she says that there is no more primordial phenomenon than the symbolic. She also notes that Catherine Malalbou'sontology of accident is a secondary effect on the symbolic field; it brings negativeness to its extreme when it destroys the meaning of the subject's psychic life. A materialist view of humanity would take into account all external threats, from volcanoes to earthquakes. But here we go back to Dickens: he was a young man who dreamed about his own future. He lived in London where he could think of nothing but battlefields. His dreams were like those of a child who died at Charingcross. He saw these places as scenes of his own fantasies.\n",

            "In this chapter, the UM uses examples from Dickens to illustrate how his hyperrealism can be used to explain what happened on the World Trade Center. He contrasts the physical reality of the building with the psychological experience of seeing it destroyed. This is because we cannot fully integrate the real into our everyday lives and therefore are forced to experience it in a dreamlike way. The only difference between these two types of experiences is that they are mutually Exclusive. Malabou criticizes psychoanalysis for ignoring the body's weight when it comes to traumatic events. For him, \"the sense of ordinary outside reality and extreme terror are mutualally exclusive.\" From abjectives to creepy: every neighbor is ultimately creepiness.\n",

The other song is about an old man who was afraid of horses because his father cut off his small penis. It is also related to Freud's child, Hans, who had a fear of horses.

The theme of Ivan is also used in this essay as an example of how abstract forms can be evoked by atonal music.

This is because they are not composed of musical elements but are rather fragments of sound from different sources.

            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how we can get to know people more easily when we don't even know who they really are. He uses Winnicotes theory that children should be alone in their mothers' presence because there is something deeply important for them to experience before they become lovers. This means that once they have been married, they must find a way to be alone with other people without being impeccably attached to them. For example, one day after colonoscopies, the doctor offers the UM to watch some old classic movies together. The UM is surprised at the offer and wonders what he will do with it. He has recently undergone colonoscoscopy and gets a small recording of his entire colonic through the whole length of his colon. It turns out that these things are very different from evolution and revolution. Revolution is opposed to evolution, which is like evolution: everything changes within the space of change while in an evolution anything moves somewhere else. There is also a deeper irony in this fact that revolution comes to mean radical change. When things return to reality, nothing changes; instead, nothing stays the same. We see two examples of this shift in the subject: Shakespeare's Richard II and Not I A. These cases show that the subject doesn't exist as it was originally supposed to be. Instead, it is \"the retroactive effect\" of its failure. If you want to know why someone is talking about you, you need to read the passages from Act 2, Scene 6, where Corneille describes the object cause of desire. What does the object make us? Why am I saying I am my beloved? What remain of me unless the symbolic title is taken away From me? How is I what I Am? What remains Of me if not the symbolic name I am? O that I had no name... But 'tisus usurp' d! Alack the heavy days That I haveworn so many winter-out And know not yet what name to ask myself. O thatI were a joke king of Snow, Standing before Bolingbrokes, To melt himself away in water drops. At the time of rebellion in 1381, Richard II was only fourteen years old. He met up with twenty thousand peasant rebels on Smithfield near London and shouted that he would be his chief and captain. After the rebels died, Richard\n",

In fact, Lacan says, there is no sexual relation between the subject and the analyst.

            "In this chapter, the author focuses on two things: 1) Heidegger's criticism of the German Empire is not about the actual existence of the Nazism; and 2) While there are still some reservations about the Jewish community, Heideger doesn't deny it. Instead, he criticizes the idea that the Jews should be exiled from Europe because they have no place in the world. The first thing to do is to reject primitive biological racism. This isn't just an example of how people can live without being oppressed by society. It's also a way for men to get into their own power through rationality and calculation. So, basically, the Jews were killed by industrialization. They didn't really want to go around killing other people, but they wanted to fight against what was going on inside them. And so they did. Now we need to look back at Hedegger as a philosopher who has been very influential in the twentieth century. We don't know whether his ideas are actually part of the project called Enlightenments or something else. If you're looking for more information on why Hegegger thinks so, let's start with Friedrich Schiller's famous poem, \"The Song Of the Bell,\" which begins with a metaphor about a family where a man goes out and works and takes risks. But when he gets too far away from his wife, she starts to lose her loyalty. She becomes a hyennea.\n",

            "In this chapter, the narrator discusses Don Carlos's situation. After the rebellion, the King survives, but as an insurmountable broken man. He has no authority to make formal decisions and is therefore forced to send for his Grand Inquistior, who knows all about the murder of Posa. The Grand Inqusitor answers Philip's questions with complete knowledge. When the King decides that it is time for him to kill Poa, the Great Inquistor does not just approve of the decision but also leaves some servants to do the dirty job. This contrasts with God who asked the Holy Spirit to give Christ permission to be sacrificed on the cross. Assuming that the death of one's only son is similar to God's request to redeem humanity, we can see why the King doesn't know what to do when he wants to justify the killing of his own son. Instead, he leaves other servants behind to do \"the dirty job\" which cannot be publicly admitted publicly. For instance, Queen Elizabeth II was pressured to agree to Mary Stuart's execution by her ministers because she did not wish to publicly assume responsibility for the crime. She refused to answer their plea without answering them. If they were my true faithfulservants, do this crimes for me; kill her without forcing me to responsible for her dead body. A more radical level of ignorance is required: at the moment of Madness when one chooses to act...one has to reduce it to merely gesture. This means that bureaucracies try to avoid making final decisions. It is impossible for a foreign student to get a certificat de bonne-vous et moteurs in Switzerland since no one can get the certificate. On another level, the same problem arises in the Stalinism system. Because there is no guarantee of the final outcome, the critics want an act without any guarantee. They want an Act Without Risk. Milner uses the example of a revolutionary leader who does not know how to react to the revolutionary movement.\n",

            "In this chapter, Lenin focuses on the distinction between two levels of knowledge: 1) S1 and 2) S2, which are connected by an index. The first level is for the \"ungrounded revolution decision\" that is ultimately supported by its own Audacity; the second is for everything else in the world, including our experience of history and scientific knowledge. He believes that Marxism connects all these features to the idea of revolutionary action. This means that there is no need for any nonknowledge in political decisions. For example, during the French Revolution it was easy to recognize most rational and courageous men who despaired because they did not know what their revolutionary actions would do in terms of continuing the revolution. However, as soon as they realized that they were mistaken, they committed all possible mistakes. They believed that the revolution had nothing to do with reality but only the imaginary mixture from past events and present assessment that is called reality. Thus, instead of understanding the difference between real and reality, they treat the revolution as something that destroys reality.\n",

            "The narrator tells us that Schiller is the poet of free will. He rejects two modes of freedom: destructive revol - triumvir freedom and the mechanical chaos of unorganized market relations. In this way, he sees power as being split into two parts: on one side, pure blind knowledge; and on another, a friend like us who can only engage in genuine friendship. This means that there are two sides to the same process. On one hand, people have no choice but to pursue their own egotistical goals. On the other hand, they do not want to be alienated by an enemy who cannot engage in real friendship. These two kinds of freedom are rejected by the art of political aestheticization. For example, we know that symbolic casting is the price for exercise of power because it introduces a difference between what we immediately are and the function we exercise. If we put on a mask of power, then we become part of the world. We don't just drop our masks or costumes, we also reveal ourselves as \"tribulations of a lady-hypena\" .\n",

He realizes that his identity as Darth Sildious is now completely debased and that he will be able to return to his former self. This is because of the ironic truth that Christ is not just a Son of God, but a divine being who dies on the Cross. The death also means that Christ has become God. It is precisely through Christ's death that Christ becomes God. If we were to compare Christ to an ordinary commodity, then it would be impossible for us to understand why Christ was so important in the Christian worldview. Instead, we should see him as the product of the excesses of human nature. When Christ dies, there is no need for anything; instead, it is necessary for something to happen. Thus, by killing Christ, we can change our destiny.\n",

            "In this chapter, the UM uses two examples to illustrate his point that the claim that God is evil can be more unsettling. The first example concerns a young woman who becomes a fanatic of the Rapture and begins to practice a new life. She marries a man named Randy and has another daughter, Mary. After six years, they are shot by a crazy man. They go to a desert camping place where they wait until they are taken into Heaven. When they get there, they find out that they are not allowed to take their own lives in order to enter heaven. At the jail, however, things turn out differently: when Mary appears with angels and tells her that she loves God, it turns out that God doesn't really care what she says. He just wants to use human beings to justify himself. This is part of Christian tradition. For example, Nicolas Malebranche points out that even though God didn't exist, Christ would have been happier at the time because he was suffering on the cross. If God did not exists, then no one would have died. But if God did exist, then nothing could be permitted. It is only through knowledge that we can escape from the material world. Gnostics believe that God acts like a cosmic Clown; instead, God acts as an agent of wisdom. Good guys turn out to become good guys. A common joke among these people is that a person who believes he isn't a seed or a farmer is taken to mental institution where doctors convince him that all men are real men. However, once he gets cured, he returns frightened again. There is a bird outside the door that will eat them.\n",

            "In this chapter, Lacan continues his argument against omnipotance. He uses the example of a child who is dependent on her mother because she cannot yet understand why she decides to do what she does. The child can only experience her as \"an omni-potent agent\" and not as an agent of God. This makes Lacan argue that there is no other beyond the Other in the world. It is impossible for us to deny it but to assert its existence without an agent. For example, Lubitsch uses the analogy of coffee without milk to explain how we can make the same coffee without cream. If we were to say that we have one cup of coffee with cream, then we would have served it without milk. But when we say that they have one without cream, we are saying that we don't have one. Thus, we pass from the point where we get a single negation into the factual statements: We have no plain coffee without any cream; so can it become a coffeewithout milk. At the level of our understanding, we see that we could change the past by making the plain coffee go without cream or milk instead of having it. This means that we can alter the counterfaction between ourselves and the white liberal system. When we say something like, \"I would have serve you coffee without my cream,\" we mean that we wouldn't be able to change the previous statement about whether we have cream or nothing else. That is, we lose the meaning of what we actually have. What we miss out on is part of our identity. So perhaps we should define a rich life along these lines.\n",

He rejects the notion that religion is simply a secularization of deliverance and Benajmin's notion of \"the weak messiaic force\" of revolution as an act of retroactive redemption from past failures; instead, he contends that it is more than just a mere materialist fantasy. He also discusses the concept of negative theology, which refers to the idea that God cannot be described through positive or negative decisions. The term negative theologies are used to describe the idea where god cannot be explained by any positive or even negative determinations. It is not necessarily scientific materialism, but rather the notion of absolute self-efficacy of reality. This perspective emphasizes the fact that existence is the fullest of the productive processes of life. There is nothing lacking in reality, however, because everything is present with its own self-reversions. Hamlet does not die when he thinks about Claudius praying. He does not kill him when his prayers are answered since he would never strike at anything less than what is right now at that x that makes Cludius king\n",

This leads to Qutb's concept of human civilization. A society which belongs solely to Allah finds expression in obeying the Divine Law and freeing all people from servitude. The principle of freedom for every person is held true because no one is slave to another. All men have equal rights regardless of their race, color, or nation. If they are not free, they are enslavers to their animal natures. Man is capable of changing his thoughts and actions but cannot decide what place or country he is born to be. Thus it becomes clear that there is no equality between men and women. It is clear that slavery is an example of how humans are oppressed by the marketplace. As such, we should also note that animals do little good when they are civilized.\n",

            "In this chapter, the UM uses the analogy of death to explain his view of Christianity. He believes that God is dead because there is no way for us to live without him. The only living being in Christianity is the son; therefore, we have to turn around the common notion that Christ is God's puppet. This means that Christians cannot be trusted with direct knowledge and unconditional certainty since they are surprised at strange signs of divine intervention. Milner defends the distinction between exactitude and substantiveity by arguing that truth is an agent who speaks through error against the facts itself. For instance, Lacan tells us that the Russian language has three words for truth: \"Itina\" which means \"the simple exactness of reported facts,\" while it means \"pravada\" meaning \"the deeper ethico-politischen truth.\" These words were used during the Cold War as evidence against the murder of Trotsky. They also refer to the fact that the main official Russian daily newspaper was Prvda instead of Istina. It is important to note that these words do not mean exactly the same thing as the actual Russian daily newspapers did when they were written about the cold war. However, one can still see how the term \"theology\" comes from the subject of something beyond human beings.\n",

            "In this chapter, the narrator argues that Christians and Muslims cannot be true because they are too primitive to believe. He rejects the notion of belief as an epistemology, which is a form of logical misunderstanding of the world. The solution for religion is tohistoricize all religions as expressions from some transcendent divination. All religions are expressed by the deepest God, dead, unconscious, evil, impotent, stupid. This is what Marx calls \"secular humanism,\" which means that all people have different kinds of desires and fears at different stages of their development. To be a Protestant is the only possible way to be one who does not believe in God himself. If we do not accept God as our supreme being, then religion is no more real than any other religion. Kiergegaard defends the concept of god as the idea that everything is impossible. He says that there is nothing God can do but return to ourselves when we reach the maximum distance between ourselves and the universe. We should not call religion a defense against this kind of experience; it is simply an attempt to defuse the void of self-representation through scientific objectivism. It is not science that erases subjectivity or science that removes subjecthood. Instead, it is the event of Nirvania, which frees us from the limitations of our self as an autonomous agent.\n",

            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how people find pleasure in the pain they are suffering. He uses a metaphor to illustrate this point: when someone is suffering, it is because of something else going on around them. When someone is happy, it means that something else is going on outside of them, which makes it impossible for them to find pleasure elsewhere. This is what Schuster calls \"the gap between desire and drive\" . It is not an unsolved problem, but a basic insight into the structure of human psychology. Deleuze sees things as nothing more than organs without bodies and subject-objects together. The difference between delusions and drives is that there is no subject or object at the beginning of the process. Subject-object distinction takes place before subject-subject distinction. Passive sublimation involves subjectivizing without subject. Drive emerges from failure into success. Lacan's approach here is passive synthesis with subject-enterprising intensities. For Delesuze, everything starts withorgans without body; the chaos multiplicity of subjects without bodies. They form the primordial transient process of passive creation out of which topic gradually emerges by active synthesis\n",

            "In this chapter, Lacan argues that the innermost drive of human beings is not felt as an internal compulsion but rather as a external force. He rejects the notion that life is self-efident and self-conscious; instead, it is a commandments and duty. The author believes that humans are inherently connected to the world through their actions. Life is governed by superegos, which operate beyond the pleasure principles. This drives them to live according to the laws of the universe: death drives people toward pain and suffering. Sade does not deny any metaphysical Moralism, but only acknowledges the cost one has to bear for it. His aim is to deconstruct sexuality so that it can become a mechanical exercise. As such, he uses the example of a hero sleeping with his bride before she marries him. If he wants to commit suicide, then he must do something that violates the prohibition against premarital sexual sex. But if he desires to commit murder, then there is no reason why he should act upon his desire. Instead, based on moral law, what we call \"passion\" is strictly sensue ethical. For example, if you want to kill a young woman because she is pregnant, then you have to do it without hurting her feelings. So, even if someone dies from clicto or dectomy, they will still be alive.\n",

            "In this chapter, the UM uses Hegelian metaphors to explain his own view of death drives. He says that in order to deny the existence of the other, the sadist despises death drive. This is because it splits subjectivity from within and makes it impossible for him to devote himself to its destructive fantasies. The only way to avoid such a separation is to free an act as its own self-interest. Malabu points out that Hegelius does not understand the negative aspect of death drive; rather, she sees it as the result of \"the pure form of death driven\" . She thinks that death drives people into a false sense of self-realization. When we destroy our subjects, they become nothing but empty forms of subjectivity which erase all their substantial content. Death drives us toward immortality.\n",

            "The narrator continues his argument against the concept of subjectivity in this chapter. He says that subjectivity is for itself only when its singularity becomes \"for itself\" and not external to anything else. Badiou, however, opposes human life because it is oriented towards serving the goods. In contrast, Lacan's philosophy of death drives human beings toward an innermost level of existence. This leads him to consider immortality as a form of eternality which can be destroyed by excessive enjoyment. For example, one can imagine two children who are constantly acting evilly against respected authorities until they both fall onto the floor and form a shapes of the two boy. Adornon was right about when he said that when one encountered a truly Evil person, it would be difficult to imagine how this person could die. We all will die, but there is no reason why we cannot escape from our own mortality. Lacan uses the example of hungry animals to illustrate his theory of erotic awareness. When hunger is expressed through eating, food is associated with pleasure. Eating also serves to convey the meaning of desire. It is important to note that lacan doesn't directly address materialism; instead, he emphasizes the importance of the relationship between desire and death. Thus, if someone wants to risk everything for his or her desires, then what does he really want? If something causes our desire simply because it involves danger and sacrifice, then perhaps we should call this desire erootic.\n",

            "In this chapter, the narrator argues that lack and excess are opposites. The difference is that we don't get first an object which is then filled in by something else. This means that language is nothing but \"a reply to...missing signifier\" . Translation: language is not just composed of signsi-flames, but it also has its own obstacles. It doesn't matter whether there is or not a subject with a missing signer. There is no sexual difference between men and women because they are subjectivated in two ways. For example, one can say man and woman are One and the other cannot exist because God does not exist. If we were to talk about what Man and Women mean, they wouldn't be One and another. But Lacan wants us to think that there is neither god nor sexual relationship. He says that both kinds of existence have their own limitations. A God exists because there must be a God; otherwise, our ordinary world would be empty without God. So, for instance, there is none of the religious idealist notions that Lacan believes. Lorenzochiesa interprets these contradictions as a result of Lacan's reading of passages from his seminar. Chiesesa reads some passages like those from Lacan himself. They all point to the discontinuity between biological life and the symbolic. These are examples of how Lacan sees the gap between the symbolic order and the real.\n",

            "In this chapter, Lacan argues that the idea of universal man is only partially supported by the fact that no particular man resists the mythic image of the non castrated father. He also contends that men do not have an adequate understanding of their father because they are too weak to understand it from the point of view of his own self-interest. The difference between these two readings is that each man has a gap in relation to the universal man. For example, one man cannot be a public servant while another can be devoted to a corrupt pervert. This means that there is no way for women to keep both dimensions apart and still maintain her private virtues. It is therefore easier for men to sustain such a relationship through the universal symbolism of Man. Finally, Chiesesa points out that sexuality is increasingly reduced to partial objects. These objects allow us to enjoy pleasure more easily than we could ever want.\n",

            "In this chapter, the UM uses Hegel's Conclussion as an example of his opposition to abstract freedom. He rejects the idea that all people are free in the same world because it is impossible to separate them into multiple parts. He believes that these parts should be divided into constituent parts so that each individual can fulfill his or her own role within the totality of society. The most straightforward formula of the Fascist dream is: \"A proper place for everybody, and everyone with his proper place.\" This means that there is no difference between what we see and what we actually see. It also means that every person has a particular role within their society. Thus, Hegel thinks about the relationship between class distinctions and sexual difference. For example, one might have a sexual relationship with a woman who is liberated but does not want to live in a society where women are oppressed by men. Another way to deal with this tension is to use the term \"divine violence,\" which Walter Benjamin used earlier in his book on violence. When he wrote this essay, he called it divine violence, meaning something without any sanction. Now, however, when he talks about class struggle, referring to the fact that justice is possible only through an action of divine violence rather than just generalization, they do not understand how to apply this logic to human actions.\n",

            "In this paper, Badiou addresses the mistake of social violence as a mere means to achieve some end. He rejects the notion that violence serves an end only when it is related as merely a means for reaching an end. The example of the Paris suburb protests in April and May of 2005 illustrates his point that there is no real hope of a positive utopian vision among the people who took part in these events. They were simply motivated by their own desire to be free from the oppressive conditions they lived in. There was no hermeneutic message or message hidden within these outburts; rather, they were what Lacan calls \"a passage a l' acte\" . It is difficult to understand why such violent strations are not just unjust, but also terrifying. A Leftist friend at the university tells him how his son came to be educated near a black high school with a large majority of black children. This dilemma cannot be resolved at this level because the very difference between private interest and world justice bears witnesses to a position which has to been overcome. Badioou defends the concept of dialectical materialism against historical materialism. He believes that dialectics can root into social practices and political struggle.\n",

            "In this chapter, Badiou focuses on the idea of envy. He rejects the notion that there will always be envy in capitalist society because it is replaced by pleasure in others' pleasures. He uses Lacan's definition of human desire as an example: \"human desire is always desired of the Other.\" This means that we have to abandon our idealistic view of equality and move toward something more just. The point of the possible is not to be raised beyond the very limit of equality. It is impossible for capitalism to advocate democratic equality, which is undermined through the actualization of its goals. For Marx, equality was the only form of inequality; his goal was to move beyond the absolute limit of unity. There are other contradictions inherent in the concept of equality, such as the fact that people vote wrongly or demand excessive state regulations. These contradictions lead us to think about the international free market. A few years ago, Mali had been described as a place where the European Union has become the main culprit of the country's poverty. If you want to abolish excessive state regulation, simply stick to your self-referential rules about free markets. Another argument against this type of militaryization is that it can only be used for a brief period of transition. However, even if one accepts the need for militarization, it cannot be imagined along those lines.\n",

            "In this chapter, Adam Phillips discusses Hegel's philosophy of mind and his theory of cubism. He uses the example of a painting as an example to illustrate how one can interpret the ugly in a way that makes the object of the painting appear ugly. The author also uses the analogy between cubicism and Argus to demonstrate how it is possible to view the world from multiple points of view. For example, Rosenkrtanz seems to ignore Hegel when he thinks about the \"ugliness\" of the human body. This contrasts with the idea of the idealized person who has no bodily organs. As for the self-preoccupied individual, Deleuze remains within the bounds of the aristocratic phronesi. He does not advocate transgression, but rather encourages us to live according to our desires.\n",

Mills's sin is jealous; Doe envies Mills for being happy with his family life and therefore does not want to kill him. The woman's death doesn't fit the story: she committed nothing sin, she was killed just to wake up uncontrollably anger in Millses.

            "In this chapter, Lacan argues that there is no class struggle in the world because there are two distinct classes. He uses examples from Lacan and Alenka to illustrate his point. The class is the exception, not the class with the proper place within society. For example, Lurenzo Chiesa's Not-Tweet Two discusses God as the symbolic God who has three faces: the real God, evil and brutally violent; the imaginary God of Job or Cartesian Malingénie cheating people all. As for Chiesan's reading of Lacan's \" formulas of seduction,\" he neglects the work of Emilia Copjec's book, \"Sex andthe Euthanasia Of Reason.\" Finally, he uses an example from Fritz Lang's Metropolis to argue that the woman of heart is the mediator between labor and capital, the guaranteeof the organic stability over social relations. This line of thought also applies to Marx's theory that humanity poses to itself its own tasks which it can solve.\n",

              "[\"In this book, Slavj ek offers his own interpretation of Hegel's philosophy. He uses the metaphor of a giant mole as an example. He considers that the mole represents the world spirit in laying its ground for enlightenment. The idea of rhizomes is also used as an analogy to the concept of Kraken, which awakens when it disturbs the smooth surfaces of history. This book addresses three main areas: onlogical, aesthetic and theological. It begins with a description of the different positions of disparity within the classical triumviral model of truth, beauty, and goodness. At the philosophical level, there is a brutal struggle between class distinctions and scientific reason.\",\n",
              " 'In this chapter, the UM uses his dialectical-metaphysical approach to define the notion of disparities. He draws a line between object-oriented thinking and self-conscious behavior by drawing a distinction between them. The difference between the subject and the substance is the division between them: the subject is the object; the substance has its own doing. The subject cannot fully grasp the substantial content of the object because it does not know how to respond to the opposing material reality. This contrasts with Christianity, where man can only attain unity with god through an effort to remove himself from material filh and ascend back to god. Disparity points toward a whole that does not fit together so that the whole appears artificially composite. It is impossible to understand why science and theology do not work together in the same way. Mao writes about women holding up half of Heaven, which means that there is great chaos beneath heaven. Marcel Prouset tells us that when he was talking to his grandmother, she subtracted her voice from the totality of his body. When he saw her, he realized that she was sick and lost in thought. At the philosophical level, truth is at the side of abstract reduction, subjection, and not upon the sideof organic totality',\n",
              " 'In this chapter, the UM uses the analogy of a dog as an example of how Hegelian universality can be applied to human beings. He says that there are always only one species or subspecies that functions like \"a filler\" and that it is impossible to make such an affirmation anti-hegelian. He also discusses the concept of concrete universality, which means that all things exist under the same conditions. The idea of concrete universalization comes from Hegel\\'s notion of universality in relation to other people. For instance, Ambedkar believes that there will be outcasts in India because of the social hierarchy. This contradiction arises from the fact that Hinduism did not have a system for dealing with untouchables. It was just a question about the foundation of religion. Although both men respect each other, their differences are insurmountably different. They argue that the solution to the problem by returning to the original noncorruptible system is more effective than abolishing the whole system. If one wants to break out into the children of god, it isn\\'t enough to remove the castes from society. But if you want to change the status of humanity, it doesn\\'t matter what kind of person you are. There are two kinds of features that are more essential: labor and speech. These are those that we use to represent our immanent desires. We don\\'t necessarily focus on these features; they are simply shared by others. Thus, when we say that speech is more essential, we mean that it makes us communicate with others. When we say man is the animal who clips its nails, we are talking about something else. That is why many people believe that sexuality is nothing but a form of reproduction. Freud sees this as the beginning of metaphysical activity. Christianity does not view sexuality as anything specific to humans since it competes with spirituality. Christianism thinks that sexual desire is the fundamental step toward the Absolute Good. Therefore, Christians do not consider sexuality to be any sort of evil. Instead, they look at it as the ultimate step towards the absolute Good. A modern individual experiences himself as his own personal experience. He has no connection to the particular circumstances of his life. He feels self-aware of the limitations of class distinctions and cannot judge whether justice is right or wrong.',\n",
              " 'In this chapter, Spinoza argues that the only way to understand human beings is through their lack of knowledge. He rejects the notion that we should use our ignorance to create morality and injunctions. Lacan emphasizes the From Human to Posthuman Man 21 deontic dimension of being himself. The difference between reality and the world is not just an ontological difference; it also exists as part of the illusion imagined by the master who delivers the message. It is here that we find ontological difference. This difference between the highest or true being and its second shadows is offuscatated by the differences between the supreme being and his secondary shadows: what was going to happen if you were heard what I are ordering you. We can now see two opposing tendencies within this approach towards overcoming humanism and Transhumanism. Posthumanists believe that science and technology will lead us into a posthumanistic mode of being where we will be unable to relate to the animal kingdom. These two opposed tendencies exist within this orientation toward overcoming humanity. PostHumanists argue that humans are one of the animals on Earth, but they do not refer to the transhumanist movement which has been taking place since the beginning of the twentieth century. Biogenetics have become popular among these anti-humanist groups because it dissolves frontiers between men and animals on one side and between humans and machine on the other',\n",
              " 'In this chapter, the UM uses the analogy of transcendentality to argue that everything in the world is always overdeterminated. He rejects the idea of overdeterminations and believes that every subject can only be overdetermine by its relation to reality. The UM also defends the notion of an onticity as opposed to an ontology because it does not involve self-experimentation but rather the \"inhuman\" core of what he calls negativeity, death drives, and otherontological difference. This means that humans are excluded from all kinds of social positions; they do not fit into the universal form of human being. It is therefore important to distinguish between premodern Cartesian subjects and antihumanist subjects. Kant was the first philosopher against humanism who rejected both terms: the void of negativity and the person. For example, Heidegger\\'s definition of being human implies that we cannot be fully human until we have our own individual selves. If we take this limitation or obstacle away, we lose ourselves. Berardi points out that the next task of science will be about harnessing the power of the brain. Brain activity is going to play a big role in the future.',\n",
              " 'In this chapter, Wollstonecraft focuses on the Carbon Liberations Front and asks whether it is possible for humans to be alienated from shared life. Hegel responds that there are two kinds of alienation: first, we can see how difficult it is to reduce the complexity of an object to the \"essential\"; and second, we cannot understand science because it is not dependent on consciousness. The latter is true, however, because science happens in History, constrained with forms of social order. It is only through high theory that we get down to the lowest level of human experience. This means that science does not depend on human consciousness, but rather its ability to perceive the real outside of our normal reality. Morton introduces the concept of interobjective hyperobjects, which are objects that are distributed throughout time and space. These objects are phased, meaning they do not exist in any particular place or time. They become more substantial when they are seen in relation to other objects. Thus, these objects are as threat to organic matter as they are against human beings. There is also a paradox inherent in anthropocentene: society became aware of self- limitation when it became strong enough to influence the balance of all life on earth',\n",

He rejects the notion of subjectivity as an absolute idea; instead, he sees the subjectivity emerges through its self-adoptation. This means that Anderson does not believe in Hegel and his critics because they attack him as a \"straw man\" who has nothing to do with the actual content of his work. Anderson also dismisses the use of science as the main scientific reference since it is important to understand how human beings are created and how they relate to one another. He believes that there must be absential features in the world that cannot be explained by physical terms. The absence of these features is what Deacon refers to in Incomplete Nature.',\n",
              " 'In this chapter, Lacan explains how subjectivity can be divided between appearance and the inaccessible content of its being. He uses the example of Bostoridge\\'s novel Winterreise to illustrate his point that subjectivity is not just a matter of appearance but also an object. The object we see as subject is nothing but itself; it is only possible because subjectivity exists in its own self-portrait. This means that subjects are separate from other objects and cannot be separated from their substantial content. For example: A stranger comes to the house and does not want to marry or have children. Because there is no reason for him to leave, he is empty. It is therefore the cause of his departure. Furthermore, since the person who left the house was rejected by his parents, they are not alienated from the real world. Thus, subjectivity has two modes of functioning: one which disturbs harmony with another and one which fills in the gap between them. Since sexual relations are part of human society, there isn\\'t any need for prosthetics. We don\\'t have first intersubjectivities without a prothetic supplement. Therefore, our subject is \"the Other Quaternal Real Thing\" . If we were to think of anything as subjectivity, we wouldn\\'t know what it is until we realize that it doesn\\'t exist at all. Instead, we pass from something to something through a series of passages. From substance to subject becomes a reflective reversional process. Subjectivity is always tearing apart unity. Reason is more important than understanding because it allows us to subsume everything else. As opposed to reasoning, however, Reason is less important than Understanding because it gives us insight into what actually is happening. When we perceive something as abstract, we blind ourselves to its constituent features. That is, we do not understand what the object is really like. What makes sense here is that we view things as abstractions rather than mere notions.',\n",

He then proceeds to discuss the concept of decoherance, which refers to \"the gap between material realities and the register of reality in another medium.\" Decoherence theories attempt to explain how things can be tricked into conforming to the laws of nature. The idea that God acts as an agent in the creation of things cannot be explained by the scientific method.',\n",
              " 'In this chapter, Bryant focuses on the idea of how we can construct our own understanding of reality. He begins by saying that it is necessary for us to defend autonomy of objects and substances, not to reduce them to their relations. This means that subject is nothing more than an inaccessible entity. Quenti Meillassouux also discusses facticity with regard to absolute contin-gency. The only way to know what is possible is through experience. It is through factsicity that we can make our way toward the absolute. For example, when we think about something as being part of another thing, it is actually self-withdrawn. When we see something as belonging to another person, we are treated as others rather than ourselves. If we were talking about God, however, we would say that God is opaque to us. Thus, all things are like Lacanian subjects: each object perceives everything as being related to another; there is no direct relation between the object and the other. Each object does not have direct access to another but instead has blind spots. Withdrawing here is the structure of objects, not an accident relation of how they relate to another object. As such, every object is withdrawn from itself. All these points lead to the question of why people do not engage in serious political action. DistitiesBryant gives two examples of communist societies: one where political jokes were really a form of resistance to the ruling ideological system, while another where the majority did not take seriously the ruling ideology. These examples illustrate how socialism fails to produce real change.',\n",

After the sheote is done, he sends a message for an official repair service but instead of doing the job, it takes him directly to the customer. The ultimate crime in any bureaucratic system is to simply do the job that one is expected to do. This cycle of repro creates space for the pleasure of being wasted. At the level of utilitarianism, there are many tasks that need to be accomplished; however, these tasks are not necessarily performed efficiently because they are caught in the circularity of repetition. A good bureaucrat always gets caught up in this cycle of repeating things, creating problems, and making people unhappy. For example, Martel uses the example of black slaves who recognized themselves as human rights subjects during the French Revolution. They misunderstood the point, believing that their own individual rights were intended only by whitemen of property. However, when the situation in Haiti was so strong that it could no longer be understood within its framework, the Bolshevs and Hitler adopted different versions of the communist movement. These new versions included economic crises, moral disintégration, and other nonideological disturbances. Thus, all these external perturbations had to be interpreted through an ideological frame. If we can imagine ideology as autopoetic systems, such as Russia in 1917, then what we can see from the outside world is nothing but \"the excess of theIn-itself\" . We cannot see what we don\\'t see. Because information is predicated on prior distinctions that allow events to take on value, it follow that systems have blind spots. It follows that reality is what you do not perceive when you perceive it.',\n",

He uses an analogy to illustrate his point: real is not part-of-reality but a virtual thing that cannot actually be seen or experienced. It is impossible for anything to exist because it is immobilized by historical forces, such as class struggle and sexual antagonism. The only way to achieve this illusion is to use symbolic meaning. This means that we can see things in terms of other people rather than with our own perceptions. Wolstonecraft then discusses the concept of stasi, which refers to stability and immobility. A person who resists something will always have the power to resist something else. For example, when a subject protests against society, it opens up the possibility of accessing the unconscious.',\n",

The subject is the contradiction that forms the central of all things; it is the subject itself that resists its objectification. This contradiction also applies to Freud\\'s idea of the unconscious as the product of dream-work. It is not simply an intention or a prediction, but rather a desire fulfilled by the work of the dreamer. Thus, the laten dream-thoughted becomes the material that the dream worker transforms into \"the manifest dream\"; the only essential thing for dreams is the labor of encodeing/masking the dream thoughts. For example, a manager may be involved in a day-dream because he wants to finance the production of a new machine. But the owner of the factory must depend upon capital to pay for the translation of the wish into the dream language. Therefore, the workers who perform the job are dependent on the capitalist to provide the necessary funds for the creation of the new device.',\n",
              " 'Hegel argues that the only way to proceed with this argument is not to dismiss freedom and equality as false, but to fight for what freedom means. If we simply dismiss the whole world as a fake, then it will end up in communism. This is because there is no unity between the rational and the laws of nature. In other words, being evil cuts off from the universe. The Bible says that Adam and Eve should become like God by eating the fruits of the tree; after they do so, God tells them that they are like one of them. But Hegel points out that subjectivity is also evil because it makes people evil. It is the gaze that perceives evil everywhere around it. Evil is an illusion: it exclusions itself from society. Good arises when we choose good through this primordial choice. We experience the Good once, after choosing evil, we become conscious of the inadequancy of 80 discriptivesour situation. Thus, the fall is at its basic, the transition form from theinsubstantial into the substance. Life as such is neither evil nor stupid; it is more than and more. The Fall is the transition from \"the insubstantials to the substance\" . A subject cannot be split between appearance and materiality. Subject is divided between appearance-to-subject. The subject is divided among appearance and content. The object that subjects are is what Laca calls objetA a, a weird objects which is not just lacking, never completely here, always giving the subject something to look at. That is why subject is nothing but confusion. When subject is seen frontally, it acquires shape only when looking backwardly. There is a gap between reality and transcendence. All three cases have the same gap between ordinary realities and transcendent dimensions. The poet sees beauty in the face of a bush, while the madman misperces a real thing as something else. They all mistake someone for God or devil. These two examples show how subjectivity can be reduced to nothing but failure to be subject. Assuming that subject is passive, subject does not stand on active intervention. Instead, subject is self-reliant.',\n",

She contends that subjects are too objective and cannot be separated from reality because they have a transcendental priori. Kant uses the term epigenesis as an example: epigenesis is \"the encounter of contingent things in experience, who actualize the transcendentally network.\" The subject becomes transcendental when it experiences its own self-inventment. This freedom allows subjectivity to act independently. If we were to enter the realm of the sublime, then we would deprove ourselves into lifeless automation or thinking machines. Hegel defends this idea by saying that we are only at the level where our actions are determined by the logic of pleasure and pain. We are reduced to mere mechanism. It is impossible for us to return to the infinite world through our actions.',\n",

He uses an example of observing a dog that does not do anything in the nighttime. The absence of such something can then be used as a source of self-reflection. This is important because it allows us to talk about what we don\\'t see or experience at all. For instance, if there is no penis in the house, then presence can arise only against its background. If there is nothing else in the room, then our presence can also arise against the fact that there is none. Thus, when someone lacks a signifying field, they have to use a symbol that has no meaning. Lévin-Strausses first introduces the concept of mana into his philosophy. Mana is a zero-signifyer, which represents nothing more than \"that floating signifier\" which is the handicap of all fimini thought. It is here that Brandom starts his reading of phenomenological theory with an understanding of experience. Hegel says that when we compare our idea of / object to this thing ourselves, we change our notion and become conscious of what it is. When we alter our notion, however, things are changed. We now know that the stick itself is bent, but instead of being bent, it is actually straight. What changes is the way we perceive the stick for us. Our perception of the stick is altered by our new notion of it. And so on. These three levels of experience are essential for knowledge: 1) we understand the stick; 2) we recognize it as real; and 3) we realize that it is really in itself. So what happens after we discover these contradictions is that we begin to discard them.',\n",

He rejects the notion that what is outwardly inconsistent is not the world itself but rather the essence of reason. The difference between objects that appear to be self-conscious and those that are not, he says, is that they do not exist in the same way. For instance, when we see a self-consciously conscious stick, we realize that it is part of the real world because it exists for us. When we see something that is completely self-confident, we know that it means something else. We also learn that there are other kinds of self-contradictions that cannot be resolved through epistemologies. These are called epistimological illusions or inadequacies. Hegel does not reconcile the two sides of reality with each other; instead, if we want to reconcile, we must change our perception of reality so that we can understand it better.',\n",

He says that everything is already there, and that this immanent contradictory action is what Lebrunch calls \"immobilisment.\" This is why Lebrun calls it immobilisticm: things become what their always-always were, not what they are today, but what they always have been. In order for these things to really change, they first have to accept that they exist in the past. For example, when a bell Button is connected to another bomb, one can only press it with the intent of doing something important. When he presses it, however, his actions are nothing more than mere impulses. If he wants to visit someone else, he does not need to be responsible for the consequences; he just needs to act on behalf of the common good. Hegelian theory emphasizes the unity of creation and finding within individuals engaged in specific actions. Thus, each individual acts according to his or her own desires and needs. There is absolutely no higher idea which governs the relationship between the initial goal and its transformation through corrections. It is impossible to reconcile objective normative structure with actuality because all people engage in them. Therefore, alienation exists only through the interaction of individuals who are involved in those structures.',\n",
              " \"In this chapter, Lebrun argues that Hegel's vision of the future is a model of an ideal society in which people will be able to find and make sense of their own lives. The idea here is that we are going to live in a world where everything is already done before it happens. This means that we have to take ourselves to being already free. If you want to get rid of your military service, you must do it as if nothing has happened. But if you want something more permanent, you need to break down the old order first. It doesn't matter what kind of revolution you go through; it only matters whether or not you actually change it. For example, if everyone thinks that the world is already dead, then they can just act as though everything has already happened. That way, when things don't work out, they won't be wasting time trying to figure out how to keep them from falling apart. So, there are two kinds of breaks: 1) formal breaks at the beginning and 2) formal breaks after the fact--the first opens up the actual process of change, while the second occurs at the final moment. These two processes are different because they involve both forms of change. The first form takes note of what has already been done, but the second acts take note of all that has already taken place. Everyone who wants to change needs to realize that their whole world is now lost. They also need to register the fact that these changes are already done so that no one ever loses his or her chance to become a better person. Finally, however, even when the battle ends, the loss of the old system becomes effective.\",\n",

He believes that there is no way for us to reach full reconciliation because of the gap between our actions and the consequences of them. We cannot ever get rid of these gaps in our lives; they are only constitutive. Each moment we build recollations which reconcile us with history, but no story is finally final. The goal of all such stories is to find out how things have changed. This means that each time we remember something, it will be different from what we already know. It also means that every time we think about something again, it becomes retroactive. For example, when Bergman tells his wife that she will leave Casablanca soon, people don't know until after the last day of shooting at the ending. They assume that one of their male partners will die or go away with her husband. But once the end comes, it appears as the only natural ending.\",\n",
              " \"In this chapter, the UM uses the analogy between God and the community of followers to explain why it is necessary for a religious community to exist. The first problem is that there are already Jewish religions that focus on life after death or on the inner belief in God. This is because Jews have already practiced such a system: they live according to the rules of their society. They do not believe in God but instead worship him as an immanent substance. Therefore, the only difference between the two religions is that they don't say much about life after dead or about the inner beliefs in God; rather, they just obey the communal rules. It is important to note that these practices are different from those of Christianity. For example, Judeaism does not say anything about living after death nor about the Inner Belief in God, while Christian religion emphasizes obedience to the communal rule. He also says that God is still alive in the community even though it doesn't explicitly say what kind of life it will lead. So how can we reconcile this relationship between necessity/contingency? First, let's look at the relationship between self-organizing contingency and subjectivity. Self-organization has to be based on self-reproduction so that one can see things as being real. Once something becomes real, however, it cannot be posited into reality by its own presumption. Thus, human subjects become subject to Christ, who is the object of all human activity. As Christians, God becomes aware of himself through Christ. If you want to know more about Jesus, go read his book, The Holy Spirit And Mankind.\",\n",

He argues that it is necessary for humans to be conscious of their actions because they are capable of justifying them with reasons. This means that they can act freely without fear of being judged by others. Pippn also argues against the notion of an object as a self; rather, he believes that only subjectivity can achieve this goal. In contrast, Kristeva emphasizes the abjectness of things as the foundation of subjectivity: \"the defining feature was for him selfconsciousness\" . The idea of something as belonging to another thing does not mean that it belongs to someone else. It means that there is no separation between what is real and what is not. Self-consciously aware subjects have the ability to distinguish between how things are and how they appear to each other. Thus, one cannot simply assert or just act without knowing why. Therefore, we must know why our actions are being taken. Pipin furthermore discusses Hegelian theories about self-reflection and reflection. He claims that these two kinds of reflection are independent of one another.',\n",
              " \"In this chapter, Hegel focuses on the concept of self-reversal and how it can be used to explain what is going on in the world. He uses examples from the classical literature as an example. A subject cannot achieve its full identity when it does not fully grasp the substantial content of the object being observed. The believer's experience of becoming abandoned by God becomes a gap between God and himself that separates him from God. Pippin also discusses the idea of absolute reflection, which means that everything is always relative to itself but only externally. Hegelian terms are absoluter Gegensetzen, or counterpunch, which refers to the effect of losing something upon itself. This implies that we do not lose our own sense of ourselves because there is no way for us to get rid of these things. We have no access to the profound presubjectative Real, so we cannot get rid off it. Absoluter Ausgangsstoß stands for the coincidence of the opposings in the action. What is found only come to be until being left behind is the result of its own absence. It is the retroactivity of its loss. Self-consciousness is one of the most important subjects in psychoanalysis. Lacan de-substantizes the unconscious into the more modern field of subjectivity. He considers the state as the self-consciously ethical substance of a person.\",\n",

He uses an analogy of earthquakes to illustrate how the concept of the unconscious can be used to describe the inner turmoil that characterizes all human beings. This is because the unconscious is not necessarily dominated by the external world, but rather its epicentre: the \"deep hypocentre\" of human experience. For example, George Kaplan has a name attached to him as a spy for the CIA. The idea of having a secret identity makes him vulnerable to foreigners and other dangers. Art and religion have a long history reaching down into Hegelian territory, but they are still separate from one another. Hegel believes that art cannot exist without the spirit; it must also exist within itself.',\n",

Pippin thinks this is what modern artists like Manet, Cezanne, and Picasso all do. In fact, they indicate alienation from society as individuals lack proper place within it. They are forced to position themselves as an independent subject without any means of identity or projecting into the artwork. This creates a sense of disorientation among the spectators. For example, in his Luncheon On the grass, he describes two naked women engaged in postcoital cleaning. Their nakedness indicates tender shame while the naked woman sits on the grass looking but not seeing. All the social divisions invade the painting; there is no source of light inside the painting. It is also apparent that the ugly gaze is one of the most powerful features of art. Art makes every shape in each member some specific activity and partial emotions. But for instance, when we look at the thousand-eyed Argus by Holbein, our eyes signal castration. When we stare at the image of thousands of eyes, however, our soul becomes visible. We cannot understand why many eyes are present in such a picture. If we ask why these eyes are so important, Freudian philosophers say that they are only used to signal castingration of the one. And then again, because of class distinctions, people return in multiplicity. There is nothing new about the Black Athena thesis.\",\n",

The idea of self-consciousness in sculptures is absent from most works because they do not express the inner self as it is expressed in the form of the eye. Instead, these works are more like an expression of spirituality than anything else. For example, Christ\\'s body was distorted by his own appearance, making him visible to the world as a human being. Both Judasm and Christianity believe that God lives in \"an unrepresentible realm,\" separated from humans by an absolute gap between them. From the sublime to the monstaus, Rosenkrrenz introduces the concept of the ugly as an object of aesthetic art.

He also warns against any attempt to escape from the patriarchical order by returning to the pre-Protectional female rhythm of drives. This is because it leads us into anti-Samitism. For example, three decades ago German nationalist leaders printed an advertisement with the slogan: Kärnten bleiben deutsch. These words were used on newspapers throughout Austria during the 1897-1897 campaign against the Slovene Threat. Since these people did not want to be associated with anything other than the word for Beetle, Freud wrote up a series of references to the meaning of Käfer when he was attempting to catch his first black beeletle at age ten. When he heard this phrase, he laughed loudly and explained that the meaning had come from being unable or unable to create one\\'s mind. Thus, we can see how Kristeva uses the term \"abjection\" to refer to all kinds of situations. She does not understand what she calls the symbolic order; she thinks only of the abjection itself. Her definition of the symbolic order comes from her understanding of the semiotic. She believes that every call to return back to the Judeo Christian Compound has repressed something else within it. It is therefore necessary for the Jew to avoid the conflict between working class/capital and the separation between the symbolic and real.',\n",

This makes him defend himself against anti-Jewism. For example, in 1931, Adolph Hitler said that they had to kill the Jewish leader within us. Because Jews are the object of the Gentlelies, and because they are so flexible, they need the Jew in order to keep their identity. Anti-Racialism is always historical phenomena, even if its internal form changes with each historical rupture. As for Kristeva\\'s theory of semiotics, she says that there is no more primordial phenomenon than the symbolic. She also notes that Catherine Malalbou\\'sontology of accident is a secondary effect on the symbolic field; it brings negativeness to its extreme when it destroys the meaning of the subject\\'s psychic life. A materialist view of humanity would take into account all external threats, from volcanoes to earthquakes. But here we go back to Dickens: he was a young man who dreamed about his own future.

It turns out that these things are very different from evolution and revolution. Revolution is opposed to evolution, which is like evolution: everything changes within the space of change while in an evolution anything moves somewhere else. There is also a deeper irony in this fact that revolution comes to mean radical change. When things return to reality, nothing changes; instead, nothing stays the same. We see two examples of this shift in the subject: Shakespeare\\'s Richard II and Not I A. These cases show that the subject doesn\\'t exist as it was originally supposed to be. Instead, it is \"the retroactive effect\" of its failure. If you want to know why someone is talking about you, you need to read the passages from Act 2, Scene 6, where Corneille describes the object cause of desire. What does the object make us? Why am I saying I am my beloved? What remain of me unless the symbolic title is taken away From me? How is I what I Am? What remains Of me if not the symbolic name I am? O that I had no name... But \\'tisus usurp\\' d! Alack the heavy days That I haveworn so many winter-out And know not yet what name to ask myself. O thatI were a joke king of Snow, Standing before Bolingbrokes, To melt himself away in water drops. At the time of rebellion in 1381, Richard II was only fourteen years old. He met up with twenty thousand peasant rebels on Smithfield near London and shouted that he would be his chief and captain. After the rebels died, Richard',\n",

Time is also connected to musical harmony; it is in this way that Richard can identify with the music and become something else. This shift towards the final line comes from the theme of love. The meaning of the word \"sign of love\" has to be explained in Lacanian terms. It is not scientific knowledge but rather the truth of what lies behind the speaker\\'s back. In fact, Lacan says, there is no sexual relation between the subject and the analyst.

She tells how she came to be in such a state and how she believes God will punish her for her suffering.',\n",

The audience realizes that this is the final shift in the play and wonders what it means. It turns out that Beckettian readers have been reading the play as if it were an epigraph for their own experience with God. They are also confused by the shifting between the Mouth and the Other. This shift seems to signal a change in the character of the speaker: she becomes more like herself instead of being something else. She does not know what to do now that she has no idea what to say. Finally, however, she can assume her word.',\n",

Instead, he criticizes the idea that the Jews should be exiled from Europe because they have no place in the world. The first thing to do is to reject primitive biological racism. This isn\\'t just an example of how people can live without being oppressed by society. It\\'s also a way for men to get into their own power through rationality and calculation. So, basically, the Jews were killed by industrialization. They didn\\'t really want to go around killing other people, but they wanted to fight against what was going on inside them. And so they did. Now we need to look back at Hedegger as a philosopher who has been very influential in the twentieth century. We don\\'t know whether his ideas are actually part of the project called Enlightenments or something else. If you\\'re looking for more information on why Hegegger thinks so, let\\'s start with Friedrich Schiller\\'s famous poem, \"The Song Of the Bell,\" which begins with a metaphor about a family where a man goes out and works and takes risks. But when he gets too far away from his wife, she starts to lose her loyalty. She becomes a hyennea.',\n",

This utopia is called Don Carlos, but it is actually more like a comedy than a tragedy.\",\n",

He has no authority to make formal decisions and is therefore forced to send for his Grand Inquistior, who knows all about the murder of Posa. The Grand Inqusitor answers Philip\\'s questions with complete knowledge. When the King decides that it is time for him to kill Poa, the Great Inquistor does not just approve of the decision but also leaves some servants to do the dirty job. This contrasts with God who asked the Holy Spirit to give Christ permission to be sacrificed on the cross. Assuming that the death of one\\'s only son is similar to God\\'s request to redeem humanity, we can see why the King doesn\\'t know what to do when he wants to justify the killing of his own son. Instead, he leaves other servants behind to do \"the dirty job\" which cannot be publicly admitted publicly. For instance, Queen Elizabeth II was pressured to agree to Mary Stuart\\'s execution by her ministers because she did not wish to publicly assume responsibility for the crime. She refused to answer their plea without answering them. If they were my true faithfulservants, do this crimes for me; kill her without forcing me to responsible for her dead body. A more radical level of ignorance is required: at the moment of Madness when one chooses to act...one has to reduce it to merely gesture. This means that bureaucracies try to avoid making final decisions. It is impossible for a foreign student to get a certificat de bonne-vous et moteurs in Switzerland since no one can get the certificate. On another level, the same problem arises in the Stalinism system. Because there is no guarantee of the final outcome, the critics want an act without any guarantee. They want an Act Without Risk. Milner uses the example of a revolutionary leader who does not know how to react to the revolutionary movement.',\n",

The first level is for the \"ungrounded revolution decision\" that is ultimately supported by its own Audacity; the second is for everything else in the world, including our experience of history and scientific knowledge. He believes that Marxism connects all these features to the idea of revolutionary action. This means that there is no need for any nonknowledge in political decisions. For example, during the French Revolution it was easy to recognize most rational and courageous men who despaired because they did not know what their revolutionary actions would do in terms of continuing the revolution. However, as soon as they realized that they were mistaken, they committed all possible mistakes. They believed that the revolution had nothing to do with reality but only the imaginary mixture from past events and present assessment that is called reality. Thus, instead of understanding the difference between real and reality, they treat the revolution as something that destroys reality.',\n",

He rejects two modes of freedom: destructive revol - triumvir freedom and the mechanical chaos of unorganized market relations. In this way, he sees power as being split into two parts: on one side, pure blind knowledge; and on another, a friend like us who can only engage in genuine friendship. This means that there are two sides to the same process. On one hand, people have no choice but to pursue their own egotistical goals. On the other hand, they do not want to be alienated by an enemy who cannot engage in real friendship. These two kinds of freedom are rejected by the art of political aestheticization. For example, we know that symbolic casting is the price for exercise of power because it introduces a difference between what we immediately are and the function we exercise. If we put on a mask of power, then we become part of the world. We don\\'t just drop our masks or costumes, we also reveal ourselves as \"tribulations of a lady-hypena\" .',\n",

This is because of the ironic truth that Christ is not just a Son of God, but a divine being who dies on the Cross. The death also means that Christ has become God. It is precisely through Christ's death that Christ becomes God. If we were to compare Christ to an ordinary commodity, then it would be impossible for us to understand why Christ was so important in the Christian worldview. Instead, we should see him as the product of the excesses of human nature. When Christ dies, there is no need for anything; instead, it is necessary for something to happen. Thus, by killing Christ, we can change our destiny.\",\n",

The first example concerns a young woman who becomes a fanatic of the Rapture and begins to practice a new life. She marries a man named Randy and has another daughter, Mary. After six years, they are shot by a crazy man. They go to a desert camping place where they wait until they are taken into Heaven. When they get there, they find out that they are not allowed to take their own lives in order to enter heaven. At the jail, however, things turn out differently: when Mary appears with angels and tells her that she loves God, it turns out that God doesn't really care what she says. He just wants to use human beings to justify himself. This is part of Christian tradition. For example, Nicolas Malebranche points out that even though God didn't exist, Christ would have been happier at the time because he was suffering on the cross. If God did not exists, then no one would have died. But if God did exist, then nothing could be permitted. It is only through knowledge that we can escape from the material world. Gnostics believe that God acts like a cosmic Clown; instead, God acts as an agent of wisdom. Good guys turn out to become good guys. A common joke among these people is that a person who believes he isn't a seed or a farmer is taken to mental institution where doctors convince him that all men are real men. However, once he gets cured, he returns frightened again. There is a bird outside the door that will eat them.\",\n",

This is because there are no time travels in our world; instead, they are just imaginary circles that do not exist in actual reality. In fact, we can only change the past through retroactivity. It is impossible for us to understand the genesis or origin of the symbolic ordering. We cannot step outside its self-regarding totality since language has no external relation to it.

He uses the example of a child who is dependent on her mother because she cannot yet understand why she decides to do what she does. The child can only experience her as \"an omni-potent agent\" and not as an agent of God. This makes Lacan argue that there is no other beyond the Other in the world. It is impossible for us to deny it but to assert its existence without an agent. For example, Lubitsch uses the analogy of coffee without milk to explain how we can make the same coffee without cream. If we were to say that we have one cup of coffee with cream, then we would have served it without milk. But when we say that they have one without cream, we are saying that we don\\'t have one. Thus, we pass from the point where we get a single negation into the factual statements: We have no plain coffee without any cream; so can it become a coffeewithout milk. At the level of our understanding, we see that we could change the past by making the plain coffee go without cream or milk instead of having it. This means that we can alter the counterfaction between ourselves and the white liberal system. When we say something like, \"I would have serve you coffee without my cream,\" we mean that we wouldn\\'t be able to change the previous statement about whether we have cream or nothing else. That is, we lose the meaning of what we actually have. What we miss out on is part of our identity. So perhaps we should define a rich life along these lines.',\n",

He contrasts the concept of phallic pleasure with the idea of counterfaction, which means that there is no difference between what is real and what is not. The only difference between these two types of truth is that they are both false; in other words, they are contradictory. This leads him to reject the notion of pious communism as an impossible fantasy because it does not exist at all.\",\n",

He also discusses the concept of negative theology, which refers to the idea that God cannot be described through positive or negative decisions. The term negative theologies are used to describe the idea where god cannot be explained by any positive or even negative determinations. It is not necessarily scientific materialism, but rather the notion of absolute self-efficacy of reality. This perspective emphasizes the fact that existence is the fullest of the productive processes of life. There is nothing lacking in reality, however, because everything is present with its own self-reversions. Hamlet does not die when he thinks about Claudius praying. He does not kill him when his prayers are answered since he would never strike at anything less than what is right now at that x that makes Cludius king',\n",

This leads to Qutb's concept of human civilization. A society which belongs solely to Allah finds expression in obeying the Divine Law and freeing all people from servitude. The principle of freedom for every person is held true because no one is slave to another. All men have equal rights regardless of their race, color, or nation. If they are not free, they are enslavers to their animal natures. Man is capable of changing his thoughts and actions but cannot decide what place or country he is born to be. Thus it becomes clear that there is no equality between men and women. It is clear that slavery is an example of how humans are oppressed by the marketplace. As such, we should also note that animals do little good when they are civilized.\",\n",

The only living being in Christianity is the son; therefore, we have to turn around the common notion that Christ is God\\'s puppet. This means that Christians cannot be trusted with direct knowledge and unconditional certainty since they are surprised at strange signs of divine intervention. Milner defends the distinction between exactitude and substantiveity by arguing that truth is an agent who speaks through error against the facts itself. For instance, Lacan tells us that the Russian language has three words for truth: \"Itina\" which means \"the simple exactness of reported facts,\" while it means \"pravada\" meaning \"the deeper ethico-politischen truth.\" These words were used during the Cold War as evidence against the murder of Trotsky. They also refer to the fact that the main official Russian daily newspaper was Prvda instead of Istina. It is important to note that these words do not mean exactly the same thing as the actual Russian daily newspapers did when they were written about the cold war. However, one can still see how the term \"theology\" comes from the subject of something beyond human beings.',\n",

He rejects the notion of belief as an epistemology, which is a form of logical misunderstanding of the world. The solution for religion is tohistoricize all religions as expressions from some transcendent divination. All religions are expressed by the deepest God, dead, unconscious, evil, impotent, stupid. This is what Marx calls \"secular humanism,\" which means that all people have different kinds of desires and fears at different stages of their development. To be a Protestant is the only possible way to be one who does not believe in God himself. If we do not accept God as our supreme being, then religion is no more real than any other religion. Kiergegaard defends the concept of god as the idea that everything is impossible. He says that there is nothing God can do but return to ourselves when we reach the maximum distance between ourselves and the universe. We should not call religion a defense against this kind of experience; it is simply an attempt to defuse the void of self-representation through scientific objectivism. It is not science that erases subjectivity or science that removes subjecthood. Instead, it is the event of Nirvania, which frees us from the limitations of our self as an autonomous agent.',\n",

He uses a metaphor to illustrate this point: when someone is suffering, it is because of something else going on around them. When someone is happy, it means that something else is going on outside of them, which makes it impossible for them to find pleasure elsewhere. This is what Schuster calls \"the gap between desire and drive\" . It is not an unsolved problem, but a basic insight into the structure of human psychology. Deleuze sees things as nothing more than organs without bodies and subject-objects together. The difference between delusions and drives is that there is no subject or object at the beginning of the process. Subject-object distinction takes place before subject-subject distinction. Passive sublimation involves subjectivizing without subject. Drive emerges from failure into success. Lacan\\'s approach here is passive synthesis with subject-enterprising intensities. For Delesuze, everything starts withorgans without body; the chaos multiplicity of subjects without bodies. They form the primordial transient process of passive creation out of which topic gradually emerges by active synthesis',\n",

He rejects the notion that life is self-efident and self-conscious; instead, it is a commandments and duty. The author believes that humans are inherently connected to the world through their actions. Life is governed by superegos, which operate beyond the pleasure principles. This drives them to live according to the laws of the universe: death drives people toward pain and suffering. Sade does not deny any metaphysical Moralism, but only acknowledges the cost one has to bear for it. His aim is to deconstruct sexuality so that it can become a mechanical exercise. As such, he uses the example of a hero sleeping with his bride before she marries him. If he wants to commit suicide, then he must do something that violates the prohibition against premarital sexual sex. But if he desires to commit murder, then there is no reason why he should act upon his desire. Instead, based on moral law, what we call \"passion\" is strictly sensue ethical. For example, if you want to kill a young woman because she is pregnant, then you have to do it without hurting her feelings. So, even if someone dies from clicto or dectomy, they will still be alive.',\n",
              " 'In this chapter, the UM uses Hegelian metaphors to explain his own view of death drives. He says that in order to deny the existence of the other, the sadist despises death drive. This is because it splits subjectivity from within and makes it impossible for him to devote himself to its destructive fantasies. The only way to avoid such a separation is to free an act as its own self-interest. Malabu points out that Hegelius does not understand the negative aspect of death drive; rather, she sees it as the result of \"the pure form of death driven\" . She thinks that death drives people into a false sense of self-realization. When we destroy our subjects, they become nothing but empty forms of subjectivity which erase all their substantial content. Death drives us toward immortality.',\n",
              " 'The narrator continues his argument against the concept of subjectivity in this chapter. He says that subjectivity is for itself only when its singularity becomes \"for itself\" and not external to anything else. Badiou, however, opposes human life because it is oriented towards serving the goods. In contrast, Lacan\\'s philosophy of death drives human beings toward an innermost level of existence. This leads him to consider immortality as a form of eternality which can be destroyed by excessive enjoyment. For example, one can imagine two children who are constantly acting evilly against respected authorities until they both fall onto the floor and form a shapes of the two boy. Adornon was right about when he said that when one encountered a truly Evil person, it would be difficult to imagine how this person could die. We all will die, but there is no reason why we cannot escape from our own mortality. Lacan uses the example of hungry animals to illustrate his theory of erotic awareness. When hunger is expressed through eating, food is associated with pleasure. Eating also serves to convey the meaning of desire. It is important to note that lacan doesn\\'t directly address materialism; instead, he emphasizes the importance of the relationship between desire and death. Thus, if someone wants to risk everything for his or her desires, then what does he really want? If something causes our desire simply because it involves danger and sacrifice, then perhaps we should call this desire erootic.',\n",
              " 'In this chapter, the narrator argues that lack and excess are opposites. The difference is that we don\\'t get first an object which is then filled in by something else. This means that language is nothing but \"a reply to...missing signifier\" . Translation: language is not just composed of signsi-flames, but it also has its own obstacles. It doesn\\'t matter whether there is or not a subject with a missing signer. There is no sexual difference between men and women because they are subjectivated in two ways. For example, one can say man and woman are One and the other cannot exist because God does not exist. If we were to talk about what Man and Women mean, they wouldn\\'t be One and another. But Lacan wants us to think that there is neither god nor sexual relationship. He says that both kinds of existence have their own limitations. A God exists because there must be a God; otherwise, our ordinary world would be empty without God. So, for instance, there is none of the religious idealist notions that Lacan believes. Lorenzochiesa interprets these contradictions as a result of Lacan\\'s reading of passages from his seminar. Chiesesa reads some passages like those from Lacan himself. They all point to the discontinuity between biological life and the symbolic. These are examples of how Lacan sees the gap between the symbolic order and the real.',\n",

He also contends that men do not have an adequate understanding of their father because they are too weak to understand it from the point of view of his own self-interest. The difference between these two readings is that each man has a gap in relation to the universal man. For example, one man cannot be a public servant while another can be devoted to a corrupt pervert. This means that there is no way for women to keep both dimensions apart and still maintain her private virtues. It is therefore easier for men to sustain such a relationship through the universal symbolism of Man. Finally, Chiesesa points out that sexuality is increasingly reduced to partial objects.

He rejects the idea that all people are free in the same world because it is impossible to separate them into multiple parts. He believes that these parts should be divided into constituent parts so that each individual can fulfill his or her own role within the totality of society. The most straightforward formula of the Fascist dream is: \"A proper place for everybody, and everyone with his proper place.\" This means that there is no difference between what we see and what we actually see. It also means that every person has a particular role within their society. Thus, Hegel thinks about the relationship between class distinctions and sexual difference. For example, one might have a sexual relationship with a woman who is liberated but does not want to live in a society where women are oppressed by men. Another way to deal with this tension is to use the term \"divine violence,\" which Walter Benjamin used earlier in his book on violence. When he wrote this essay, he called it divine violence, meaning something without any sanction. Now, however, when he talks about class struggle, referring to the fact that justice is possible only through an action of divine violence rather than just generalization, they do not understand how to apply this logic to human actions.',\n",

He rejects the notion that violence serves an end only when it is related as merely a means for reaching an end. The example of the Paris suburb protests in April and May of 2005 illustrates his point that there is no real hope of a positive utopian vision among the people who took part in these events. They were simply motivated by their own desire to be free from the oppressive conditions they lived in. There was no hermeneutic message or message hidden within these outburts; rather, they were what Lacan calls \"a passage a l\\' acte\" . It is difficult to understand why such violent strations are not just unjust, but also terrifying. A Leftist friend at the university tells him how his son came to be educated near a black high school with a large majority of black children. This dilemma cannot be resolved at this level because the very difference between private interest and world justice bears witnesses to a position which has to been overcome.

He rejects the notion that there will always be envy in capitalist society because it is replaced by pleasure in others\\' pleasures. He uses Lacan\\'s definition of human desire as an example: \"human desire is always desired of the Other.\" This means that we have to abandon our idealistic view of equality and move toward something more just. The point of the possible is not to be raised beyond the very limit of equality. It is impossible for capitalism to advocate democratic equality, which is undermined through the actualization of its goals. For Marx, equality was the only form of inequality; his goal was to move beyond the absolute limit of unity. There are other contradictions inherent in the concept of equality, such as the fact that people vote wrongly or demand excessive state regulations. These contradictions lead us to think about the international free market. A few years ago, Mali had been described as a place where the European Union has become the main culprit of the country\\'s poverty. If you want to abolish excessive state regulation, simply stick to your self-referential rules about free markets.

            "The narrator responds to the claim that there is no god at all, but rather an illusion of God. He also defends Lacan's notion of indiffference as radical indifferentness. In contrast, his critique of Will begins with the question of why Chiesan thinks nothing is more real than nothing. He rejects the idea of retroactive illusion because it displaces the past into the present.\n",
            "Hegel argues that the only way to proceed with this argument is not to dismiss freedom and equality as false, but to fight for what freedom means. If we simply dismiss the whole world as a fake, then it will end up in communism. This is because there is no unity between the rational and the laws of nature. In other words, being evil cuts off from the universe. The Bible says that Adam and Eve should become like God by eating the fruits of the tree; after they do so, God tells them that they are like one of them. But Hegel points out that subjectivity is also evil because it makes people evil. It is the gaze that perceives evil everywhere around it. Evil is an illusion: it exclusions itself from society. Good arises when we choose good through this primordial choice. We experience the Good once, after choosing evil, we become conscious of the inadequancy of 80 discriptivesour situation. Thus, the fall is at its basic, the transition form from theinsubstantial into the substance. Life as such is neither evil nor stupid; it is more than and more. The Fall is the transition from \"the insubstantials to the substance\" . A subject cannot be split between appearance and materiality. Subject is divided between appearance-to-subject. The subject is divided among appearance and content. The object that subjects are is what Laca calls objetA a, a weird objects which is not just lacking, never completely here, always giving the subject something to look at. That is why subject is nothing but confusion. When subject is seen frontally, it acquires shape only when looking backwardly. There is a gap between reality and transcendence. All three cases have the same gap between ordinary realities and transcendent dimensions. The poet sees beauty in the face of a bush, while the madman misperces a real thing as something else. They all mistake someone for God or devil. These two examples show how subjectivity can be reduced to nothing but failure to be subject. Assuming that subject is passive, subject does not stand on active intervention. Instead, subject is self-reliant.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses the analogy between God and the community of followers to explain why it is necessary for a religious community to exist. The first problem is that there are already Jewish religions that focus on life after death or on the inner belief in God. This is because Jews have already practiced such a system: they live according to the rules of their society. They do not believe in God but instead worship him as an immanent substance. Therefore, the only difference between the two religions is that they don't say much about life after dead or about the inner beliefs in God; rather, they just obey the communal rules. It is important to note that these practices are different from those of Christianity. For example, Judeaism does not say anything about living after death nor about the Inner Belief in God, while Christian religion emphasizes obedience to the communal rule. He also says that God is still alive in the community even though it doesn't explicitly say what kind of life it will lead. So how can we reconcile this relationship between necessity/contingency? First, let's look at the relationship between self-organizing contingency and subjectivity. Self-organization has to be based on self-reproduction so that one can see things as being real. Once something becomes real, however, it cannot be posited into reality by its own presumption. Thus, human subjects become subject to Christ, who is the object of all human activity. As Christians, God becomes aware of himself through Christ. If you want to know more about Jesus, go read his book, The Holy Spirit And Mankind.\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how Palpatine's face is transformed when he confronts Anakin. He realizes that his identity as Darth Sildious is now completely debased and that he will be able to return to his former self. This is because of the ironic truth that Christ is not just a Son of God, but a divine being who dies on the Cross. The death also means that Christ has become God. It is precisely through Christ's death that Christ becomes God. If we were to compare Christ to an ordinary commodity, then it would be impossible for us to understand why Christ was so important in the Christian worldview. Instead, we should see him as the product of the excesses of human nature. When Christ dies, there is no need for anything; instead, it is necessary for something to happen. Thus, by killing Christ, we can change our destiny.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses two examples to illustrate his point that the claim that God is evil can be more unsettling. The first example concerns a young woman who becomes a fanatic of the Rapture and begins to practice a new life. She marries a man named Randy and has another daughter, Mary. After six years, they are shot by a crazy man. They go to a desert camping place where they wait until they are taken into Heaven. When they get there, they find out that they are not allowed to take their own lives in order to enter heaven. At the jail, however, things turn out differently: when Mary appears with angels and tells her that she loves God, it turns out that God doesn't really care what she says. He just wants to use human beings to justify himself. This is part of Christian tradition. For example, Nicolas Malebranche points out that even though God didn't exist, Christ would have been happier at the time because he was suffering on the cross. If God did not exists, then no one would have died. But if God did exist, then nothing could be permitted. It is only through knowledge that we can escape from the material world. Gnostics believe that God acts like a cosmic Clown; instead, God acts as an agent of wisdom. Good guys turn out to become good guys. A common joke among these people is that a person who believes he isn't a seed or a farmer is taken to mental institution where doctors convince him that all men are real men. However, once he gets cured, he returns frightened again. There is a bird outside the door that will eat them.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses the example of Christ's seven last words to argue that the ultimate case of his broken vessel is God himself. He contrasts the concept of phallic pleasure with the idea of counterfaction, which means that there is no difference between what is real and what is not. The only difference between these two types of truth is that they are both false; in other words, they are contradictory. This leads him to reject the notion of pious communism as an impossible fantasy because it does not exist at all.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses Hegelian logic to argue that there is no religious dimension in any of the radical political projects. He rejects the notion that religion is simply a secularization of deliverance and Benajmin's notion of \"the weak messiaic force\" of revolution as an act of retroactive redemption from past failures; instead, he contends that it is more than just a mere materialist fantasy. He also discusses the concept of negative theology, which refers to the idea that God cannot be described through positive or negative decisions. The term negative theologies are used to describe the idea where god cannot be explained by any positive or even negative determinations. It is not necessarily scientific materialism, but rather the notion of absolute self-efficacy of reality. This perspective emphasizes the fact that existence is the fullest of the productive processes of life. There is nothing lacking in reality, however, because everything is present with its own self-reversions. Hamlet does not die when he thinks about Claudius praying. He does not kill him when his prayers are answered since he would never strike at anything less than what is right now at that x that makes Cludius king\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator continues his argument against Christianity. He defends the idea that God is in love with one another and that man can be perfect only by sin. This leads to Qutb's concept of human civilization. A society which belongs solely to Allah finds expression in obeying the Divine Law and freeing all people from servitude. The principle of freedom for every person is held true because no one is slave to another. All men have equal rights regardless of their race, color, or nation. If they are not free, they are enslavers to their animal natures. Man is capable of changing his thoughts and actions but cannot decide what place or country he is born to be. Thus it becomes clear that there is no equality between men and women. It is clear that slavery is an example of how humans are oppressed by the marketplace. As such, we should also note that animals do little good when they are civilized.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses the analogy of death to explain his view of Christianity. He believes that God is dead because there is no way for us to live without him. The only living being in Christianity is the son; therefore, we have to turn around the common notion that Christ is God's puppet. This means that Christians cannot be trusted with direct knowledge and unconditional certainty since they are surprised at strange signs of divine intervention. Milner defends the distinction between exactitude and substantiveity by arguing that truth is an agent who speaks through error against the facts itself. For instance, Lacan tells us that the Russian language has three words for truth: \"Itina\" which means \"the simple exactness of reported facts,\" while it means \"pravada\" meaning \"the deeper ethico-politischen truth.\" These words were used during the Cold War as evidence against the murder of Trotsky. They also refer to the fact that the main official Russian daily newspaper was Prvda instead of Istina. It is important to note that these words do not mean exactly the same thing as the actual Russian daily newspapers did when they were written about the cold war. However, one can still see how the term \"theology\" comes from the subject of something beyond human beings.\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator argues that Christians and Muslims cannot be true because they are too primitive to believe. He rejects the notion of belief as an epistemology, which is a form of logical misunderstanding of the world. The solution for religion is tohistoricize all religions as expressions from some transcendent divination. All religions are expressed by the deepest God, dead, unconscious, evil, impotent, stupid. This is what Marx calls \"secular humanism,\" which means that all people have different kinds of desires and fears at different stages of their development. To be a Protestant is the only possible way to be one who does not believe in God himself. If we do not accept God as our supreme being, then religion is no more real than any other religion. Kiergegaard defends the concept of god as the idea that everything is impossible. He says that there is nothing God can do but return to ourselves when we reach the maximum distance between ourselves and the universe. We should not call religion a defense against this kind of experience; it is simply an attempt to defuse the void of self-representation through scientific objectivism. It is not science that erases subjectivity or science that removes subjecthood. Instead, it is the event of Nirvania, which frees us from the limitations of our self as an autonomous agent.\n",
            "In this chapter, Lacan argues that there is no class struggle in the world because there are two distinct classes. He uses examples from Lacan and Alenka to illustrate his point. The class is the exception, not the class with the proper place within society. For example, Lurenzo Chiesa's Not-Tweet Two discusses God as the symbolic God who has three faces: the real God, evil and brutally violent; the imaginary God of Job or Cartesian Malingénie cheating people all. As for Chiesan's reading of Lacan's \" formulas of seduction,\" he neglects the work of Emilia Copjec's book, \"Sex andthe Euthanasia Of Reason.\" Finally, he uses an example from Fritz Lang's Metropolis to argue that the woman of heart is the mediator between labor and capital, the guaranteeof the organic stability over social relations. This line of thought also applies to Marx's theory that humanity poses to itself its own tasks which it can solve.\n",

            "In this chapter, Malabou argues that the subject of self-retrieval is not limited to objects, but rather extends beyond them. She contends that subjects are too objective and cannot be separated from reality because they have a transcendental priori. Kant uses the term epigenesis as an example: epigenesis is \"the encounter of contingent things in experience, who actualize the transcendentally network.\" The subject becomes transcendental when it experiences its own self-inventment. This freedom allows subjectivity to act independently. If we were to enter the realm of the sublime, then we would deprove ourselves into lifeless automation or thinking machines. Hegel defends this idea by saying that we are only at the level where our actions are determined by the logic of pleasure and pain. We are reduced to mere mechanism. It is impossible for us to return to the infinite world through our actions.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses his dialectical-metaphysical approach to define the notion of disparities. He draws a line between object-oriented thinking and self-conscious behavior by drawing a distinction between them. The difference between the subject and the substance is the division between them: the subject is the object; the substance has its own doing. The subject cannot fully grasp the substantial content of the object because it does not know how to respond to the opposing material reality. This contrasts with Christianity, where man can only attain unity with god through an effort to remove himself from material filh and ascend back to god. Disparity points toward a whole that does not fit together so that the whole appears artificially composite. It is impossible to understand why science and theology do not work together in the same way. Mao writes about women holding up half of Heaven, which means that there is great chaos beneath heaven. Marcel Prouset tells us that when he was talking to his grandmother, she subtracted her voice from the totality of his body. When he saw her, he realized that she was sick and lost in thought. At the philosophical level, truth is at the side of abstract reduction, subjection, and not upon the sideof organic totality\n",
            "In this chapter, Lacan explains how subjectivity can be divided between appearance and the inaccessible content of its being. He uses the example of Bostoridge's novel Winterreise to illustrate his point that subjectivity is not just a matter of appearance but also an object. The object we see as subject is nothing but itself; it is only possible because subjectivity exists in its own self-portrait. This means that subjects are separate from other objects and cannot be separated from their substantial content. For example: A stranger comes to the house and does not want to marry or have children. Because there is no reason for him to leave, he is empty. It is therefore the cause of his departure. Furthermore, since the person who left the house was rejected by his parents, they are not alienated from the real world. Thus, subjectivity has two modes of functioning: one which disturbs harmony with another and one which fills in the gap between them. Since sexual relations are part of human society, there isn't any need for prosthetics. We don't have first intersubjectivities without a prothetic supplement. Therefore, our subject is \"the Other Quaternal Real Thing\" . If we were to think of anything as subjectivity, we wouldn't know what it is until we realize that it doesn't exist at all. Instead, we pass from something to something through a series of passages. From substance to subject becomes a reflective reversional process. Subjectivity is always tearing apart unity. Reason is more important than understanding because it allows us to subsume everything else. As opposed to reasoning, however, Reason is less important than Understanding because it gives us insight into what actually is happening. When we perceive something as abstract, we blind ourselves to its constituent features. That is, we do not understand what the object is really like. What makes sense here is that we view things as abstractions rather than mere notions.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses the example of an abstract subject to illustrate how different his personal identity is from that of an ordinary human being. He then proceeds to discuss the concept of decoherance, which refers to \"the gap between material realities and the register of reality in another medium.\" Decoherence theories attempt to explain how things can be tricked into conforming to the laws of nature. The idea that God acts as an agent in the creation of things cannot be explained by the scientific method.\n",
            "In this chapter, Bryant focuses on the idea of how we can construct our own understanding of reality. He begins by saying that it is necessary for us to defend autonomy of objects and substances, not to reduce them to their relations. This means that subject is nothing more than an inaccessible entity. Quenti Meillassouux also discusses facticity with regard to absolute contin-gency. The only way to know what is possible is through experience. It is through factsicity that we can make our way toward the absolute. For example, when we think about something as being part of another thing, it is actually self-withdrawn. When we see something as belonging to another person, we are treated as others rather than ourselves. If we were talking about God, however, we would say that God is opaque to us. Thus, all things are like Lacanian subjects: each object perceives everything as being related to another; there is no direct relation between the object and the other. Each object does not have direct access to another but instead has blind spots. Withdrawing here is the structure of objects, not an accident relation of how they relate to another object. As such, every object is withdrawn from itself. All these points lead to the question of why people do not engage in serious political action. DistitiesBryant gives two examples of communist societies: one where political jokes were really a form of resistance to the ruling ideological system, while another where the majority did not take seriously the ruling ideology. These examples illustrate how socialism fails to produce real change.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses Hegel's concept of experience to explain his failure in speculating on the relationship between subjects and predicates. The subject is the contradiction that forms the central of all things; it is the subject itself that resists its objectification. This contradiction also applies to Freud's idea of the unconscious as the product of dream-work. It is not simply an intention or a prediction, but rather a desire fulfilled by the work of the dreamer. Thus, the laten dream-thoughted becomes the material that the dream worker transforms into \"the manifest dream\"; the only essential thing for dreams is the labor of encodeing/masking the dream thoughts. For example, a manager may be involved in a day-dream because he wants to finance the production of a new machine. But the owner of the factory must depend upon capital to pay for the translation of the wish into the dream language. Therefore, the workers who perform the job are dependent on the capitalist to provide the necessary funds for the creation of the new device.\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how different objects can be represented in relation to one another. He uses an example of observing a dog that does not do anything in the nighttime. The absence of such something can then be used as a source of self-reflection. This is important because it allows us to talk about what we don't see or experience at all. For instance, if there is no penis in the house, then presence can arise only against its background. If there is nothing else in the room, then our presence can also arise against the fact that there is none. Thus, when someone lacks a signifying field, they have to use a symbol that has no meaning. Lévin-Strausses first introduces the concept of mana into his philosophy. Mana is a zero-signifyer, which represents nothing more than \"that floating signifier\" which is the handicap of all fimini thought. It is here that Brandom starts his reading of phenomenological theory with an understanding of experience. Hegel says that when we compare our idea of / object to this thing ourselves, we change our notion and become conscious of what it is. When we alter our notion, however, things are changed. We now know that the stick itself is bent, but instead of being bent, it is actually straight. What changes is the way we perceive the stick for us. Our perception of the stick is altered by our new notion of it. And so on. These three levels of experience are essential for knowledge: 1) we understand the stick; 2) we recognize it as real; and 3) we realize that it is really in itself. So what happens after we discover these contradictions is that we begin to discard them.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses the example of an unfortunate stick as an example of how contradiction can be resolved by thinking about it. He rejects the notion that what is outwardly inconsistent is not the world itself but rather the essence of reason. The difference between objects that appear to be self-conscious and those that are not, he says, is that they do not exist in the same way. For instance, when we see a self-consciously conscious stick, we realize that it is part of the real world because it exists for us. When we see something that is completely self-confident, we know that it means something else. We also learn that there are other kinds of self-contradictions that cannot be resolved through epistemologies. These are called epistimological illusions or inadequacies. Hegel does not reconcile the two sides of reality with each other; instead, if we want to reconcile, we must change our perception of reality so that we can understand it better.\n",
            "Pippin defends Hegel's principle of self-consistency, freedom, and reason in this paper. He argues that it is necessary for humans to be conscious of their actions because they are capable of justifying them with reasons. This means that they can act freely without fear of being judged by others. Pippn also argues against the notion of an object as a self; rather, he believes that only subjectivity can achieve this goal. In contrast, Kristeva emphasizes the abjectness of things as the foundation of subjectivity: \"the defining feature was for him selfconsciousness\" . The idea of something as belonging to another thing does not mean that it belongs to someone else. It means that there is no separation between what is real and what is not. Self-consciously aware subjects have the ability to distinguish between how things are and how they appear to each other. Thus, one cannot simply assert or just act without knowing why. Therefore, we must know why our actions are being taken. Pipin furthermore discusses Hegelian theories about self-reflection and reflection. He claims that these two kinds of reflection are independent of one another.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses the analogy of an abject to explain how we can avoid being abject. He discusses two kinds of abjection: 1) those who do not give up or assume a prohibition; and 2) those who take advantage of them. The first kind is that they don't believe in anything but the law. The second type is that people fall into their own traps, which are created by us as we fall into our own trap\n",

            "In this chapter, Lenin focuses on the distinction between two levels of knowledge: 1) S1 and 2) S2, which are connected by an index. The first level is for the \"ungrounded revolution decision\" that is ultimately supported by its own Audacity; the second is for everything else in the world, including our experience of history and scientific knowledge. He believes that Marxism connects all these features to the idea of revolutionary action. This means that there is no need for any nonknowledge in political decisions. For example, during the French Revolution it was easy to recognize most rational and courageous men who despaired because they did not know what their revolutionary actions would do in terms of continuing the revolution. However, as soon as they realized that they were mistaken, they committed all possible mistakes. They believed that the revolution had nothing to do with reality but only the imaginary mixture from past events and present assessment that is called reality. Thus, instead of understanding the difference between real and reality, they treat the revolution as something that destroys reality.\n",
            "In this chapter, Lebrun argues that Hegel's vision of the future is a model of an ideal society in which people will be able to find and make sense of their own lives. The idea here is that we are going to live in a world where everything is already done before it happens. This means that we have to take ourselves to being already free. If you want to get rid of your military service, you must do it as if nothing has happened. But if you want something more permanent, you need to break down the old order first. It doesn't matter what kind of revolution you go through; it only matters whether or not you actually change it. For example, if everyone thinks that the world is already dead, then they can just act as though everything has already happened. That way, when things don't work out, they won't be wasting time trying to figure out how to keep them from falling apart. So, there are two kinds of breaks: 1) formal breaks at the beginning and 2) formal breaks after the fact--the first opens up the actual process of change, while the second occurs at the final moment. These two processes are different because they involve both forms of change. The first form takes note of what has already been done, but the second acts take note of all that has already taken place. Everyone who wants to change needs to realize that their whole world is now lost. They also need to register the fact that these changes are already done so that no one ever loses his or her chance to become a better person. Finally, however, even when the battle ends, the loss of the old system becomes effective.\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator discusses some of the most important lines from Schiller's work. He begins with a discussion of how his first book The Robberers was about the danger of unconstrained free will and then proceeds to discuss the theme of friendship, love and political power. It is clear that Schiller wants to create a kind of utopia in which all people are equals under the same roof. This utopia is called Don Carlos, but it is actually more like a comedy than a tragedy.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses Hegel's Conclussion as an example of his opposition to abstract freedom. He rejects the idea that all people are free in the same world because it is impossible to separate them into multiple parts. He believes that these parts should be divided into constituent parts so that each individual can fulfill his or her own role within the totality of society. The most straightforward formula of the Fascist dream is: \"A proper place for everybody, and everyone with his proper place.\" This means that there is no difference between what we see and what we actually see. It also means that every person has a particular role within their society. Thus, Hegel thinks about the relationship between class distinctions and sexual difference. For example, one might have a sexual relationship with a woman who is liberated but does not want to live in a society where women are oppressed by men. Another way to deal with this tension is to use the term \"divine violence,\" which Walter Benjamin used earlier in his book on violence. When he wrote this essay, he called it divine violence, meaning something without any sanction. Now, however, when he talks about class struggle, referring to the fact that justice is possible only through an action of divine violence rather than just generalization, they do not understand how to apply this logic to human actions.\n",
            "In this paper, Badiou addresses the mistake of social violence as a mere means to achieve some end. He rejects the notion that violence serves an end only when it is related as merely a means for reaching an end. The example of the Paris suburb protests in April and May of 2005 illustrates his point that there is no real hope of a positive utopian vision among the people who took part in these events. They were simply motivated by their own desire to be free from the oppressive conditions they lived in. There was no hermeneutic message or message hidden within these outburts; rather, they were what Lacan calls \"a passage a l' acte\" . It is difficult to understand why such violent strations are not just unjust, but also terrifying. A Leftist friend at the university tells him how his son came to be educated near a black high school with a large majority of black children. This dilemma cannot be resolved at this level because the very difference between private interest and world justice bears witnesses to a position which has to been overcome. Badioou defends the concept of dialectical materialism against historical materialism. He believes that dialectics can root into social practices and political struggle.\n",
            "In this chapter, Badiou focuses on the idea of envy. He rejects the notion that there will always be envy in capitalist society because it is replaced by pleasure in others' pleasures. He uses Lacan's definition of human desire as an example: \"human desire is always desired of the Other.\" This means that we have to abandon our idealistic view of equality and move toward something more just. The point of the possible is not to be raised beyond the very limit of equality. It is impossible for capitalism to advocate democratic equality, which is undermined through the actualization of its goals. For Marx, equality was the only form of inequality; his goal was to move beyond the absolute limit of unity. There are other contradictions inherent in the concept of equality, such as the fact that people vote wrongly or demand excessive state regulations. These contradictions lead us to think about the international free market. A few years ago, Mali had been described as a place where the European Union has become the main culprit of the country's poverty. If you want to abolish excessive state regulation, simply stick to your self-referential rules about free markets. Another argument against this type of militaryization is that it can only be used for a brief period of transition. However, even if one accepts the need for militarization, it cannot be imagined along those lines.\n",

She tells how she came to be in such a state and how she believes God will punish her for her suffering.\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator discusses the various forms of literature that confront and sublimate abjectness. The most famous is Céline's \"long voyage to the Bottom of the Night,\" in which he describes the night as the night of an abject. He also warns against any attempt to escape from the patriarchical order by returning to the pre-Protectional female rhythm of drives. This is because it leads us into anti-Samitism. For example, three decades ago German nationalist leaders printed an advertisement with the slogan: Kärnten bleiben deutsch. These words were used on newspapers throughout Austria during the 1897-1897 campaign against the Slovene Threat. Since these people did not want to be associated with anything other than the word for Beetle, Freud wrote up a series of references to the meaning of Käfer when he was attempting to catch his first black beeletle at age ten. When he heard this phrase, he laughed loudly and explained that the meaning had come from being unable or unable to create one's mind. Thus, we can see how Kristeva uses the term \"abjection\" to refer to all kinds of situations. She does not understand what she calls the symbolic order; she thinks only of the abjection itself. Her definition of the symbolic order comes from her understanding of the semiotic. She believes that every call to return back to the Judeo Christian Compound has repressed something else within it. It is therefore necessary for the Jew to avoid the conflict between working class/capital and the separation between the symbolic and real.\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how we can get to know people more easily when we don't even know who they really are. He uses Winnicotes theory that children should be alone in their mothers' presence because there is something deeply important for them to experience before they become lovers. This means that once they have been married, they must find a way to be alone with other people without being impeccably attached to them. For example, one day after colonoscopies, the doctor offers the UM to watch some old classic movies together. The UM is surprised at the offer and wonders what he will do with it. He has recently undergone colonoscoscopy and gets a small recording of his entire colonic through the whole length of his colon. It turns out that these things are very different from evolution and revolution. Revolution is opposed to evolution, which is like evolution: everything changes within the space of change while in an evolution anything moves somewhere else. There is also a deeper irony in this fact that revolution comes to mean radical change. When things return to reality, nothing changes; instead, nothing stays the same. We see two examples of this shift in the subject: Shakespeare's Richard II and Not I A. These cases show that the subject doesn't exist as it was originally supposed to be. Instead, it is \"the retroactive effect\" of its failure. If you want to know why someone is talking about you, you need to read the passages from Act 2, Scene 6, where Corneille describes the object cause of desire. What does the object make us? Why am I saying I am my beloved? What remain of me unless the symbolic title is taken away From me? How is I what I Am? What remains Of me if not the symbolic name I am? O that I had no name... But 'tisus usurp' d! Alack the heavy days That I haveworn so many winter-out And know not yet what name to ask myself. O thatI were a joke king of Snow, Standing before Bolingbrokes, To melt himself away in water drops. At the time of rebellion in 1381, Richard II was only fourteen years old.

The solution for religion is tohistoricize all religions as expressions from some transcendent divination. All religions are expressed by the deepest God, dead, unconscious, evil, impotent, stupid. This is what Marx calls \"secular humanism,\" which means that all people have different kinds of desires and fears at different stages of their development. To be a Protestant is the only possible way to be one who does not believe in God himself. If we do not accept God as our supreme being, then religion is no more real than any other religion. Kiergegaard defends the concept of god as the idea that everything is impossible. He says that there is nothing God can do but return to ourselves when we reach the maximum distance between ourselves and the universe. We should not call religion a defense against this kind of experience; it is simply an attempt to defuse the void of self-representation through scientific objectivism. It is not science that erases subjectivity or science that removes subjecthood. Instead, it is the event of Nirvania, which frees us from the limitations of our self as an autonomous agent.\n",

            "In this chapter, the narrator argues that lack and excess are opposites. The difference is that we don't get first an object which is then filled in by something else. This means that language is nothing but \"a reply to...missing signifier\" . Translation: language is not just composed of signsi-flames, but it also has its own obstacles. It doesn't matter whether there is or not a subject with a missing signer. There is no sexual difference between men and women because they are subjectivated in two ways. For example, one can say man and woman are One and the other cannot exist because God does not exist. If we were to talk about what Man and Women mean, they wouldn't be One and another. But Lacan wants us to think that there is neither god nor sexual relationship. He says that both kinds of existence have their own limitations. A God exists because there must be a God; otherwise, our ordinary world would be empty without God. So, for instance, there is none of the religious idealist notions that Lacan believes. Lorenzochiesa interprets these contradictions as a result of Lacan's reading of passages from his seminar. Chiesesa reads some passages like those from Lacan himself. They all point to the discontinuity between biological life and the symbolic. These are examples of how Lacan sees the gap between the symbolic order and the real.\n",

            "In this chapter, Hegel focuses on the concept of self-reversal and how it can be used to explain what is going on in the world. He uses examples from the classical literature as an example. A subject cannot achieve its full identity when it does not fully grasp the substantial content of the object being observed. The believer's experience of becoming abandoned by God becomes a gap between God and himself that separates him from God. Pippin also discusses the idea of absolute reflection, which means that everything is always relative to itself but only externally. Hegelian terms are absoluter Gegensetzen, or counterpunch, which refers to the effect of losing something upon itself. This implies that we do not lose our own sense of ourselves because there is no way for us to get rid of these things. We have no access to the profound presubjectative Real, so we cannot get rid off it. Absoluter Ausgangsstoß stands for the coincidence of the opposings in the action. What is found only come to be until being left behind is the result of its own absence. It is the retroactivity of its loss. Self-consciousness is one of the most important subjects in psychoanalysis. Lacan de-substantizes the unconscious into the more modern field of subjectivity. He considers the state as the self-consciously ethical substance of a person.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses the analogy of a dog as an example of how Hegelian universality can be applied to human beings. He says that there are always only one species or subspecies that functions like \"a filler\" and that it is impossible to make such an affirmation anti-hegelian. He also discusses the concept of concrete universality, which means that all things exist under the same conditions. The idea of concrete universalization comes from Hegel's notion of universality in relation to other people. For instance, Ambedkar believes that there will be outcasts in India because of the social hierarchy. This contradiction arises from the fact that Hinduism did not have a system for dealing with untouchables. It was just a question about the foundation of religion. Although both men respect each other, their differences are insurmountably different. They argue that the solution to the problem by returning to the original noncorruptible system is more effective than abolishing the whole system. If one wants to break out into the children of god, it isn't enough to remove the castes from society. But if you want to change the status of humanity, it doesn't matter what kind of person you are. There are two kinds of features that are more essential: labor and speech. These are those that we use to represent our immanent desires. We don't necessarily focus on these features; they are simply shared by others. Thus, when we say that speech is more essential, we mean that it makes us communicate with others. When we say man is the animal who clips its nails, we are talking about something else. That is why many people believe that sexuality is nothing but a form of reproduction. Freud sees this as the beginning of metaphysical activity. Christianity does not view sexuality as anything specific to humans since it competes with spirituality. Christianism thinks that sexual desire is the fundamental step toward the Absolute Good. Therefore, Christians do not consider sexuality to be any sort of evil. Instead, they look at it as the ultimate step towards the absolute Good. A modern individual experiences himself as his own personal experience. He has no connection to the particular circumstances of his life. He feels self-aware of the limitations of class distinctions and cannot judge whether justice is right or wrong.\n",
            "In this chapter, Anderson argues that Hegel's idealism is the only thing that can be broken out of the idealist dialectical process. He rejects the notion of subjectivity as an absolute idea; instead, he sees the subjectivity emerges through its self-adoptation. This means that Anderson does not believe in Hegel and his critics because they attack him as a \"straw man\" who has nothing to do with the actual content of his work. Anderson also dismisses the use of science as the main scientific reference since it is important to understand how human beings are created and how they relate to one another. He believes that there must be absential features in the world that cannot be explained by physical terms. The absence of these features is what Deacon refers to in Incomplete Nature.\n",
            "The narrator uses the example of the 1920s collectivation of land as an example of Hegel's immobilism. He says that everything is already there, and that this immanent contradictory action is what Lebrunch calls \"immobilisment.\" This is why Lebrun calls it immobilisticm: things become what their always-always were, not what they are today, but what they always have been. In order for these things to really change, they first have to accept that they exist in the past. For example, when a bell Button is connected to another bomb, one can only press it with the intent of doing something important. When he presses it, however, his actions are nothing more than mere impulses. If he wants to visit someone else, he does not need to be responsible for the consequences; he just needs to act on behalf of the common good. Hegelian theory emphasizes the unity of creation and finding within individuals engaged in specific actions. Thus, each individual acts according to his or her own desires and needs. There is absolutely no higher idea which governs the relationship between the initial goal and its transformation through corrections. It is impossible to reconcile objective normative structure with actuality because all people engage in them. Therefore, alienation exists only through the interaction of individuals who are involved in those structures.\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how Hegel's theory of self-reflection works in relation to his theory of reason. He uses an analogy of earthquakes to illustrate how the concept of the unconscious can be used to describe the inner turmoil that characterizes all human beings. This is because the unconscious is not necessarily dominated by the external world, but rather its epicentre: the \"deep hypocentre\" of human experience. For example, George Kaplan has a name attached to him as a spy for the CIA. The idea of having a secret identity makes him vulnerable to foreigners and other dangers. Art and religion have a long history reaching down into Hegelian territory, but they are still separate from one another. Hegel believes that art cannot exist without the spirit; it must also exist within itself.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses Hegel's philosophy of physics to argue that there is something at play at the very highest level of human experience.

He also discusses Hegelian ideas about self-consciousity and how they relate to Hegel in particular.\n",

He uses an analogy to illustrate his point: real is not part-of-reality but a virtual thing that cannot actually be seen or experienced. It is impossible for anything to exist because it is immobilized by historical forces, such as class struggle and sexual antagonism. The only way to achieve this illusion is to use symbolic meaning. This means that we can see things in terms of other people rather than with our own perceptions. Wolstonecraft then discusses the concept of stasi, which refers to stability and immobility. A person who resists something will always have the power to resist something else. For example, when a subject protests against society, it opens up the possibility of accessing the unconscious.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses examples from Dickens to illustrate how his hyperrealism can be used to explain what happened on the World Trade Center.

This is because we cannot fully integrate the real into our everyday lives and therefore are forced to experience it in a dreamlike way. The only difference between these two types of experiences is that they are mutually Exclusive. Malabou criticizes psychoanalysis for ignoring the body's weight when it comes to traumatic events. For him, \"the sense of ordinary outside reality and extreme terror are mutualally exclusive.\" From abjectives to creepy: every neighbor is ultimately creepiness.\n",

            "Hegel's greatest failure in art is not that he can see the infinite goal already realized. The illusion of reconciliation is ultimately the reconciliation with failure itself. Pippin thinks this is what modern artists like Manet, Cezanne, and Picasso all do. In fact, they indicate alienation from society as individuals lack proper place within it. They are forced to position themselves as an independent subject without any means of identity or projecting into the artwork. This creates a sense of disorientation among the spectators. For example, in his Luncheon On the grass, he describes two naked women engaged in postcoital cleaning. Their nakedness indicates tender shame while the naked woman sits on the grass looking but not seeing. All the social divisions invade the painting; there is no source of light inside the painting. It is also apparent that the ugly gaze is one of the most powerful features of art. Art makes every shape in each member some specific activity and partial emotions. But for instance, when we look at the thousand-eyed Argus by Holbein, our eyes signal castration. When we stare at the image of thousands of eyes, however, our soul becomes visible. We cannot understand why many eyes are present in such a picture. If we ask why these eyes are so important, Freudian philosophers say that they are only used to signal castingration of the one. And then again, because of class distinctions, people return in multiplicity. There is nothing new about the Black Athena thesis.\n",
            "In this book, Slavj ek offers his own interpretation of Hegel's philosophy. He uses the metaphor of a giant mole as an example. He considers that the mole represents the world spirit in laying its ground for enlightenment. The idea of rhizomes is also used as an analogy to the concept of Kraken, which awakens when it disturbs the smooth surfaces of history. This book addresses three main areas: onlogical, aesthetic and theological. It begins with a description of the different positions of disparity within the classical triumviral model of truth, beauty, and goodness. At the philosophical level, there is a brutal struggle between class distinctions and scientific reason.\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how Hegelian philosophy has changed over the last century. The idea of self-consciousness in sculptures is absent from most works because they do not express the inner self as it is expressed in the form of the eye. Instead, these works are more like an expression of spirituality than anything else. For example, Christ's body was distorted by his own appearance, making him visible to the world as a human being. Both Judasm and Christianity believe that God lives in \"an unrepresentible realm,\" separated from humans by an absolute gap between them. From the sublime to the monstaus, Rosenkrrenz introduces the concept of the ugly as an object of aesthetic art. He uses the term \"ugliness\" to refer to the fact that something can be ugly even though it is beautiful. This means that one can have both good and bad qualities at the same time.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses Hegel's metaphors to explain how fear and sopsis can be used to create ideals. The UM also discusses the possibility of art after the death of art, as it is comical in its portrayal of everyday life. For example, one might imagine a Muslim being mocked for his deformity while another imagines a corpse being slit open by a spider. This would lead to comedy, since there is no moral conflict between the two worlds.\n",
            "In this chapter, Adam Phillips discusses Hegel's philosophy of mind and his theory of cubism. He uses the example of a painting as an example to illustrate how one can interpret the ugly in a way that makes the object of the painting appear ugly. The author also uses the analogy between cubicism and Argus to demonstrate how it is possible to view the world from multiple points of view. For example, Rosenkrtanz seems to ignore Hegel when he thinks about the \"ugliness\" of the human body. This contrasts with the idea of the idealized person who has no bodily organs. As for the self-preoccupied individual, Deleuze remains within the bounds of the aristocratic phronesi. He does not advocate transgression, but rather encourages us to live according to our desires.\n",

            "The narrator continues his argument against the concept of subjectivity in this chapter. He says that subjectivity is for itself only when its singularity becomes \"for itself\" and not external to anything else. Badiou, however, opposes human life because it is oriented towards serving the goods. In contrast, Lacan's philosophy of death drives human beings toward an innermost level of existence. This leads him to consider immortality as a form of eternality which can be destroyed by excessive enjoyment. For example, one can imagine two children who are constantly acting evilly against respected authorities until they both fall onto the floor and form a shapes of the two boy. Adornon was right about when he said that when one encountered a truly Evil person, it would be difficult to imagine how this person could die. We all will die, but there is no reason why we cannot escape from our own mortality. Lacan uses the example of hungry animals to illustrate his theory of erotic awareness. When hunger is expressed through eating, food is associated with pleasure. Eating also serves to convey the meaning of desire. It is important to note that lacan doesn't directly address materialism; instead, he emphasizes the importance of the relationship between desire and death. Thus, if someone wants to risk everything for his or her desires, then what does he really want? If something causes our desire simply because it involves danger and sacrifice, then perhaps we should call this desire erootic.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses the analogy of transcendentality to argue that everything in the world is always overdeterminated. He rejects the idea of overdeterminations and believes that every subject can only be overdetermine by its relation to reality. The UM also defends the notion of an onticity as opposed to an ontology because it does not involve self-experimentation but rather the \"inhuman\" core of what he calls negativeity, death drives, and otherontological difference. This means that humans are excluded from all kinds of social positions; they do not fit into the universal form of human being. It is therefore important to distinguish between premodern Cartesian subjects and antihumanist subjects. Kant was the first philosopher against humanism who rejected both terms: the void of negativity and the person. For example, Heidegger's definition of being human implies that we cannot be fully human until we have our own individual selves. If we take this limitation or obstacle away, we lose ourselves. Berardi points out that the next task of science will be about harnessing the power of the brain. Brain activity is going to play a big role in the future.\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how we are ashamed of our innermost self-sacrifice because it comes out from our \"interior\" . He says that animals do not have any problem with their outermost intimacy; they just don't have one. The only problem with life is that it gets destroyed by the external world. It becomes inorganic and loses its vitality. Life is disgusting at the way it got there. There are some really sublime moments in Ridley Scotsman's Alienrection: One of the first is when Ripley goes to the laboratory room where the aborted versions of herself are on display. She sees them but doesn't get rid of them. The second is when she finds a piece of paper on the floor next to her body. This is like a message from the other scene. Hitchcock takes great pleasure in cleaning the bathroom after his work. He thinks about how perfect an act can be for evil purposes. He also considers how morally inappropriate it is for Hegelian art to claim that it is beautiful. Hegel does not yet understand the ways in which abstract art works.\n",
            "Boulter argues that the whole of the Triumvirate is about getting rid of subjects. The subjectivity is no longer an object, but only partially alive. It is timeless. Scenes from happy lives are the focus of this chapter. In Not I, the audience is introduced to a woman who has been suffering for many years. She tells how she came to be in such a state and how she believes God will punish her for her suffering.\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how people find pleasure in the pain they are suffering. He uses a metaphor to illustrate this point: when someone is suffering, it is because of something else going on around them. When someone is happy, it means that something else is going on outside of them, which makes it impossible for them to find pleasure elsewhere. This is what Schuster calls \"the gap between desire and drive\" . It is not an unsolved problem, but a basic insight into the structure of human psychology. Deleuze sees things as nothing more than organs without bodies and subject-objects together. The difference between delusions and drives is that there is no subject or object at the beginning of the process. Subject-object distinction takes place before subject-subject distinction. Passive sublimation involves subjectivizing without subject. Drive emerges from failure into success. Lacan's approach here is passive synthesis with subject-enterprising intensities. For Delesuze, everything starts withorgans without body; the chaos multiplicity of subjects without bodies. They form the primordial transient process of passive creation out of which topic gradually emerges by active synthesis\n",
            "In this chapter, Lacan argues that the innermost drive of human beings is not felt as an internal compulsion but rather as a external force. He rejects the notion that life is self-efident and self-conscious; instead, it is a commandments and duty. The author believes that humans are inherently connected to the world through their actions. Life is governed by superegos, which operate beyond the pleasure principles. This drives them to live according to the laws of the universe: death drives people toward pain and suffering. Sade does not deny any metaphysical Moralism, but only acknowledges the cost one has to bear for it. His aim is to deconstruct sexuality so that it can become a mechanical exercise. As such, he uses the example of a hero sleeping with his bride before she marries him. If he wants to commit suicide, then he must do something that violates the prohibition against premarital sexual sex. But if he desires to commit murder, then there is no reason why he should act upon his desire. Instead, based on moral law, what we call \"passion\" is strictly sensue ethical. For example, if you want to kill a young woman because she is pregnant, then you have to do it without hurting her feelings. So, even if someone dies from clicto or dectomy, they will still be alive.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses Hegelian metaphors to explain his own view of death drives. He says that in order to deny the existence of the other, the sadist despises death drive. This is because it splits subjectivity from within and makes it impossible for him to devote himself to its destructive fantasies. The only way to avoid such a separation is to free an act as its own self-interest. Malabu points out that Hegelius does not understand the negative aspect of death drive; rather, she sees it as the result of \"the pure form of death driven\" . She thinks that death drives people into a false sense of self-realization. When we destroy our subjects, they become nothing but empty forms of subjectivity which erase all their substantial content. Death drives us toward immortality.\n",

            "In this chapter, the narrator discusses Don Carlos's situation. After the rebellion, the King survives, but as an insurmountable broken man. He has no authority to make formal decisions and is therefore forced to send for his Grand Inquistior, who knows all about the murder of Posa. The Grand Inqusitor answers Philip's questions with complete knowledge. When the King decides that it is time for him to kill Poa, the Great Inquistor does not just approve of the decision but also leaves some servants to do the dirty job. This contrasts with God who asked the Holy Spirit to give Christ permission to be sacrificed on the cross. Assuming that the death of one's only son is similar to God's request to redeem humanity, we can see why the King doesn't know what to do when he wants to justify the killing of his own son. Instead, he leaves other servants behind to do \"the dirty job\" which cannot be publicly admitted publicly. For instance, Queen Elizabeth II was pressured to agree to Mary Stuart's execution by her ministers because she did not wish to publicly assume responsibility for the crime. She refused to answer their plea without answering them. If they were my true faithfulservants, do this crimes for me; kill her without forcing me to responsible for her dead body. A more radical level of ignorance is required: at the moment of Madness when one chooses to act...one has to reduce it to merely gesture. This means that bureaucracies try to avoid making final decisions. It is impossible for a foreign student to get a certificat de bonne-vous et moteurs in Switzerland since no one can get the certificate. On another level, the same problem arises in the Stalinism system. Because there is no guarantee of the final outcome, the critics want an act without any guarantee. They want an Act Without Risk. Milner uses the example of a revolutionary leader who does not know how to react to the revolutionary movement.\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how bureaucracies work. He describes two scenes in which a hero loses his plumbing and goes to the state repair service to get help. After the sheote is done, he sends a message for an official repair service but instead of doing the job, it takes him directly to the customer. The ultimate crime in any bureaucratic system is to simply do the job that one is expected to do. This cycle of repro creates space for the pleasure of being wasted. At the level of utilitarianism, there are many tasks that need to be accomplished; however, these tasks are not necessarily performed efficiently because they are caught in the circularity of repetition. A good bureaucrat always gets caught up in this cycle of repeating things, creating problems, and making people unhappy. For example, Martel uses the example of black slaves who recognized themselves as human rights subjects during the French Revolution. They misunderstood the point, believing that their own individual rights were intended only by whitemen of property. However, when the situation in Haiti was so strong that it could no longer be understood within its framework, the Bolshevs and Hitler adopted different versions of the communist movement. These new versions included economic crises, moral disintégration, and other nonideological disturbances. Thus, all these external perturbations had to be interpreted through an ideological frame. If we can imagine ideology as autopoetic systems, such as Russia in 1917, then what we can see from the outside world is nothing but \"the excess of theIn-itself\" . We cannot see what we don't see. Because information is predicated on prior distinctions that allow events to take on value, it follow that systems have blind spots. It follows that reality is what you do not perceive when you perceive it.\n",
            "The narrator tells us that Schiller is the poet of free will. He rejects two modes of freedom: destructive revol - triumvir freedom and the mechanical chaos of unorganized market relations. In this way, he sees power as being split into two parts: on one side, pure blind knowledge; and on another, a friend like us who can only engage in genuine friendship. This means that there are two sides to the same process. On one hand, people have no choice but to pursue their own egotistical goals. On the other hand, they do not want to be alienated by an enemy who cannot engage in real friendship. These two kinds of freedom are rejected by the art of political aestheticization. For example, we know that symbolic casting is the price for exercise of power because it introduces a difference between what we immediately are and the function we exercise. If we put on a mask of power, then we become part of the world. We don't just drop our masks or costumes, we also reveal ourselves as \"tribulations of a lady-hypena\" .\n",

            "Richard continues his monologue, reiterating the idea that music is an object of truth. He uses this as a metaphor for time, which is out of joint with society. Time is also connected to musical harmony; it is in this way that Richard can identify with the music and become something else. This shift towards the final line comes from the theme of love. The meaning of the word \"sign of love\" has to be explained in Lacanian terms. It is not scientific knowledge but rather the truth of what lies behind the speaker's back. In fact, Lacan says, there is no sexual relation between the subject and the analyst. The only difference between the two reals is that Beckt cuts down on the richness of the language while Joyce cuts down all the riches of the text.\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how creepiness can be found in all forms of art and literature. The most famous example of creepiness comes from Heintjian singer Norman Bates who sings two songs about abandonment. One is about a young boy who begged his mother to give him a little baby horse so that he could go to heaven. The other song is about an old man who was afraid of horses because his father cut off his small penis. It is also related to Freud's child, Hans, who had a fear of horses. This makes the song more interesting than it might have been before.\n",

The theme of Ivan is also used in this essay as an example of how abstract forms can be evoked by atonal music. In particular, Carnaval, a work by Robert Schumann, has twenty-one parts that are not performed effectively. These sections are fragmentary and do not correspond to the actual content of the piece. This is because they are not composed of musical elements but are rather fragments of sound from different sources. At this point, we realize that the meaning of these fragments is not yet clear; it is just a way of thinking about the immanent world of experience.\n",

            "In this chapter, Lacan argues that the idea of universal man is only partially supported by the fact that no particular man resists the mythic image of the non castrated father. He also contends that men do not have an adequate understanding of their father because they are too weak to understand it from the point of view of his own self-interest. The difference between these two readings is that each man has a gap in relation to the universal man. For example, one man cannot be a public servant while another can be devoted to a corrupt pervert. This means that there is no way for women to keep both dimensions apart and still maintain her private virtues. It is therefore easier for men to sustain such a relationship through the universal symbolism of Man. Finally, Chiesesa points out that sexuality is increasingly reduced to partial objects. These objects allow us to enjoy pleasure more easily than we could ever want.\n",
            "In this chapter, Lacan continues his argument against omnipotance. He uses the example of a child who is dependent on her mother because she cannot yet understand why she decides to do what she does. The child can only experience her as \"an omni-potent agent\" and not as an agent of God. This makes Lacan argue that there is no other beyond the Other in the world. It is impossible for us to deny it but to assert its existence without an agent. For example, Lubitsch uses the analogy of coffee without milk to explain how we can make the same coffee without cream. If we were to say that we have one cup of coffee with cream, then we would have served it without milk. But when we say that they have one without cream, we are saying that we don't have one. Thus, we pass from the point where we get a single negation into the factual statements: We have no plain coffee without any cream; so can it become a coffeewithout milk. At the level of our understanding, we see that we could change the past by making the plain coffee go without cream or milk instead of having it. This means that we can alter the counterfaction between ourselves and the white liberal system. When we say something like, \"I would have serve you coffee without my cream,\" we mean that we wouldn't be able to change the previous statement about whether we have cream or nothing else. That is, we lose the meaning of what we actually have. What we miss out on is part of our identity. So perhaps we should define a rich life along these lines.\n",

He begins by saying that it is necessary for us to defend autonomy of objects and substances, not to reduce them to their relations. This means that subject is nothing more than an inaccessible entity. Quenti Meillassouux also discusses facticity with regard to absolute contin-gency. The only way to know what is possible is through experience. It is through factsicity that we can make our way toward the absolute. For example, when we think about something as being part of another thing, it is actually self-withdrawn. When we see something as belonging to another person, we are treated as others rather than ourselves. If we were talking about God, however, we would say that God is opaque to us. Thus, all things are like Lacanian subjects: each object perceives everything as being related to another; there is no direct relation between the object and the other. Each object does not have direct access to another but instead has blind spots. Withdrawing here is the structure of objects, not an accident relation of how they relate to another object. As such, every object is withdrawn from itself. All these points lead to the question of why people do not engage in serious political action. DistitiesBryant gives two examples of communist societies: one where political jokes were really a form of resistance to the ruling ideological system, while another where the majority did not take seriously the ruling ideology. These examples illustrate how socialism fails to produce real change.\n",

            "In this chapter, the author focuses on two things: 1) Heidegger's criticism of the German Empire is not about the actual existence of the Nazism; and 2) While there are still some reservations about the Jewish community, Heideger doesn't deny it. Instead, he criticizes the idea that the Jews should be exiled from Europe because they have no place in the world. The first thing to do is to reject primitive biological racism. This isn't just an example of how people can live without being oppressed by society. It's also a way for men to get into their own power through rationality and calculation. So, basically, the Jews were killed by industrialization. They didn't really want to go around killing other people, but they wanted to fight against what was going on inside them. And so they did. Now we need to look back at Hedegger as a philosopher who has been very influential in the twentieth century. We don't know whether his ideas are actually part of the project called Enlightenments or something else. If you're looking for more information on why Hegegger thinks so, let's start with Friedrich Schiller's famous poem, \"The Song Of the Bell,\" which begins with a metaphor about a family where a man goes out and works and takes risks. But when he gets too far away from his wife, she starts to lose her loyalty. She becomes a hyennea.\n",
            "The narrator uses the example of Freud to explain how his rejection of an \"inassimilably joussance\" can lead to barbarism, which is what causes people to reject their own identities. In this way, Lacan sees himself as a group of people who reject the other's jibes. He does not know who or why he is, but he recognizes himself among others who have rejected it. This makes him defend himself against anti-Jewism. For example, in 1931, Adolph Hitler said that they had to kill the Jewish leader within us. Because Jews are the object of the Gentlelies, and because they are so flexible, they need the Jew in order to keep their identity. Anti-Racialism is always historical phenomena, even if its internal form changes with each historical rupture. As for Kristeva's theory of semiotics, she says that there is no more primordial phenomenon than the symbolic. She also notes that Catherine Malalbou'sontology of accident is a secondary effect on the symbolic field; it brings negativeness to its extreme when it destroys the meaning of the subject's psychic life. A materialist view of humanity would take into account all external threats, from volcanoes to earthquakes. But here we go back to Dickens: he was a young man who dreamed about his own future. He lived in London where he could think of nothing but battlefields. His dreams were like those of a child who died at Charingcross. He saw these places as scenes of his own fantasies.\n",

            "In this chapter, Wollstonecraft focuses on the Carbon Liberations Front and asks whether it is possible for humans to be alienated from shared life. Hegel responds that there are two kinds of alienation: first, we can see how difficult it is to reduce the complexity of an object to the \"essential\"; and second, we cannot understand science because it is not dependent on consciousness. The latter is true, however, because science happens in History, constrained with forms of social order. It is only through high theory that we get down to the lowest level of human experience. This means that science does not depend on human consciousness, but rather its ability to perceive the real outside of our normal reality. Morton introduces the concept of interobjective hyperobjects, which are objects that are distributed throughout time and space. These objects are phased, meaning they do not exist in any particular place or time. They become more substantial when they are seen in relation to other objects. Thus, these objects are as threat to organic matter as they are against human beings. There is also a paradox inherent in anthropocentene: society became aware of self- limitation when it became strong enough to influence the balance of all life on earth\n",
            "In this chapter, Spinoza argues that the only way to understand human beings is through their lack of knowledge. He rejects the notion that we should use our ignorance to create morality and injunctions. Lacan emphasizes the From Human to Posthuman Man 21 deontic dimension of being himself. The difference between reality and the world is not just an ontological difference; it also exists as part of the illusion imagined by the master who delivers the message. It is here that we find ontological difference. This difference between the highest or true being and its second shadows is offuscatated by the differences between the supreme being and his secondary shadows: what was going to happen if you were heard what I are ordering you. We can now see two opposing tendencies within this approach towards overcoming humanism and Transhumanism. Posthumanists believe that science and technology will lead us into a posthumanistic mode of being where we will be unable to relate to the animal kingdom. These two opposed tendencies exist within this orientation toward overcoming humanity. PostHumanists argue that humans are one of the animals on Earth, but they do not refer to the transhumanist movement which has been taking place since the beginning of the twentieth century. Biogenetics have become popular among these anti-humanist groups because it dissolves frontiers between men and animals on one side and between humans and machine on the other\n",

This is because there are no time travels in our world; instead, they are just imaginary circles that do not exist in actual reality. In fact, we can only change the past through retroactivity. It is impossible for us to understand the genesis or origin of the symbolic ordering. We cannot step outside its self-regarding totality since language has no external relation to it. But the Is God dead, unconscious, evil, impotent, stupid ... 286other side of these circularity ofthe symbolic order, which has no outer, is that truth is totally indispensible towards it, with none relation towards it\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how we can never reconcile ourselves to the past. He believes that there is no way for us to reach full reconciliation because of the gap between our actions and the consequences of them. We cannot ever get rid of these gaps in our lives; they are only constitutive. Each moment we build recollations which reconcile us with history, but no story is finally final. The goal of all such stories is to find out how things have changed. This means that each time we remember something, it will be different from what we already know. It also means that every time we think about something again, it becomes retroactive. For example, when Bergman tells his wife that she will leave Casablanca soon, people don't know until after the last day of shooting at the ending. They assume that one of their male partners will die or go away with her husband. But once the end comes, it appears as the only natural ending.\n",

Then, in the final scene of the play, all different possible versions of what happened are cancelled.\n",

            "In this chapter, the UM uses his dialectical-metaphysical approach to define the notion of disparities. He draws a line between object-oriented thinking and self-conscious behavior by drawing a distinction between them. The difference between the subject and the substance is the division between them: the subject is the object; the substance has its own doing. The subject cannot fully grasp the substantial content of the object because it does not know how to respond to the opposing material reality. This contrasts with Christianity, where man can only attain unity with god through an effort to remove himself from material filh and ascend back to god. Disparity points toward a whole that does not fit together so that the whole appears artificially composite. It is impossible to understand why science and theology do not work together in the same way. Mao writes about women holding up half of Heaven, which means that there is great chaos beneath heaven. Marcel Prouset tells us that when he was talking to his grandmother, she subtracted her voice from the totality of his body. When he saw her, he realized that she was sick and lost in thought. At the philosophical level, truth is at the side of abstract reduction, subjection, and not upon the sideof organic totality\n",
            "In this chapter, Lacan explains how subjectivity can be divided between appearance and the inaccessible content of its being. He uses the example of Bostoridge's novel Winterreise to illustrate his point that subjectivity is not just a matter of appearance but also an object. The object we see as subject is nothing but itself; it is only possible because subjectivity exists in its own self-portrait. This means that subjects are separate from other objects and cannot be separated from their substantial content. For example: A stranger comes to the house and does not want to marry or have children. Because there is no reason for him to leave, he is empty. It is therefore the cause of his departure. Furthermore, since the person who left the house was rejected by his parents, they are not alienated from the real world. Thus, subjectivity has two modes of functioning: one which disturbs harmony with another and one which fills in the gap between them. Since sexual relations are part of human society, there isn't any need for prosthetics. We don't have first intersubjectivities without a prothetic supplement. Therefore, our subject is \"the Other Quaternal Real Thing\" . If we were to think of anything as subjectivity, we wouldn't know what it is until we realize that it doesn't exist at all. Instead, we pass from something to something through a series of passages. From substance to subject becomes a reflective reversional process. Subjectivity is always tearing apart unity. Reason is more important than understanding because it allows us to subsume everything else. As opposed to reasoning, however, Reason is less important than Understanding because it gives us insight into what actually is happening. When we perceive something as abstract, we blind ourselves to its constituent features. That is, we do not understand what the object is really like. What makes sense here is that we view things as abstractions rather than mere notions.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses the example of an abstract subject to illustrate how different his personal identity is from that of an ordinary human being. He then proceeds to discuss the concept of decoherance, which refers to \"the gap between material realities and the register of reality in another medium.\" Decoherence theories attempt to explain how things can be tricked into conforming to the laws of nature. The idea that God acts as an agent in the creation of things cannot be explained by the scientific method.\n",

            "In this chapter, the UM uses Hegel's concept of experience to explain his failure in speculating on the relationship between subjects and predicates. The subject is the contradiction that forms the central of all things; it is the subject itself that resists its objectification. This contradiction also applies to Freud's idea of the unconscious as the product of dream-work. It is not simply an intention or a prediction, but rather a desire fulfilled by the work of the dreamer. Thus, the laten dream-thoughted becomes the material that the dream worker transforms into \"the manifest dream\"; the only essential thing for dreams is the labor of encodeing/masking the dream thoughts. For example, a manager may be involved in a day-dream because he wants to finance the production of a new machine. But the owner of the factory must depend upon capital to pay for the translation of the wish into the dream language. Therefore, the workers who perform the job are dependent on the capitalist to provide the necessary funds for the creation of the new device.\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how different objects can be represented in relation to one another. He uses an example of observing a dog that does not do anything in the nighttime. The absence of such something can then be used as a source of self-reflection. This is important because it allows us to talk about what we don't see or experience at all. For instance, if there is no penis in the house, then presence can arise only against its background. If there is nothing else in the room, then our presence can also arise against the fact that there is none. Thus, when someone lacks a signifying field, they have to use a symbol that has no meaning. Lévin-Strausses first introduces the concept of mana into his philosophy. Mana is a zero-signifyer, which represents nothing more than \"that floating signifier\" which is the handicap of all fimini thought. It is here that Brandom starts his reading of phenomenological theory with an understanding of experience. Hegel says that when we compare our idea of / object to this thing ourselves, we change our notion and become conscious of what it is. When we alter our notion, however, things are changed. We now know that the stick itself is bent, but instead of being bent, it is actually straight. What changes is the way we perceive the stick for us. Our perception of the stick is altered by our new notion of it. And so on. These three levels of experience are essential for knowledge: 1) we understand the stick; 2) we recognize it as real; and 3) we realize that it is really in itself. So what happens after we discover these contradictions is that we begin to discard them.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses the example of an unfortunate stick as an example of how contradiction can be resolved by thinking about it. He rejects the notion that what is outwardly inconsistent is not the world itself but rather the essence of reason. The difference between objects that appear to be self-conscious and those that are not, he says, is that they do not exist in the same way. For instance, when we see a self-consciously conscious stick, we realize that it is part of the real world because it exists for us. When we see something that is completely self-confident, we know that it means something else. We also learn that there are other kinds of self-contradictions that cannot be resolved through epistemologies. These are called epistimological illusions or inadequacies. Hegel does not reconcile the two sides of reality with each other; instead, if we want to reconcile, we must change our perception of reality so that we can understand it better.\n",
            "Pippin defends Hegel's principle of self-consistency, freedom, and reason in this paper. He argues that it is necessary for humans to be conscious of their actions because they are capable of justifying them with reasons. This means that they can act freely without fear of being judged by others. Pippn also argues against the notion of an object as a self; rather, he believes that only subjectivity can achieve this goal. In contrast, Kristeva emphasizes the abjectness of things as the foundation of subjectivity: \"the defining feature was for him selfconsciousness\" . The idea of something as belonging to another thing does not mean that it belongs to someone else. It means that there is no separation between what is real and what is not. Self-consciously aware subjects have the ability to distinguish between how things are and how they appear to each other. Thus, one cannot simply assert or just act without knowing why. Therefore, we must know why our actions are being taken. Pipin furthermore discusses Hegelian theories about self-reflection and reflection. He claims that these two kinds of reflection are independent of one another.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses the analogy of an abject to explain how we can avoid being abject. He discusses two kinds of abjection: 1) those who do not give up or assume a prohibition; and 2) those who take advantage of them. The first kind is that they don't believe in anything but the law. The second type is that people fall into their own traps, which are created by us as we fall into our own trap\n"

He rejects the idea of retroactive illusion because it displaces the past into the present.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses the analogy between God and the community of followers to explain why it is necessary for a religious community to exist. The first problem is that there are already Jewish religions that focus on life after death or on the inner belief in God. This is because Jews have already practiced such a system: they live according to the rules of their society. They do not believe in God but instead worship him as an immanent substance. Therefore, the only difference between the two religions is that they don't say much about life after dead or about the inner beliefs in God; rather, they just obey the communal rules. It is important to note that these practices are different from those of Christianity. For example, Judeaism does not say anything about living after death nor about the Inner Belief in God, while Christian religion emphasizes obedience to the communal rule. He also says that God is still alive in the community even though it doesn't explicitly say what kind of life it will lead. So how can we reconcile this relationship between necessity/contingency? First, let's look at the relationship between self-organizing contingency and subjectivity. Self-organization has to be based on self-reproduction so that one can see things as being real. Once something becomes real, however, it cannot be posited into reality by its own presumption. Thus, human subjects become subject to Christ, who is the object of all human activity. As Christians, God becomes aware of himself through Christ. If you want to know more about Jesus, go read his book, The Holy Spirit And Mankind.\n",
            "Hegel argues that the only way to proceed with this argument is not to dismiss freedom and equality as false, but to fight for what freedom means. If we simply dismiss the whole world as a fake, then it will end up in communism. This is because there is no unity between the rational and the laws of nature. In other words, being evil cuts off from the universe. The Bible says that Adam and Eve should become like God by eating the fruits of the tree; after they do so, God tells them that they are like one of them. But Hegel points out that subjectivity is also evil because it makes people evil. It is the gaze that perceives evil everywhere around it. Evil is an illusion: it exclusions itself from society. Good arises when we choose good through this primordial choice. We experience the Good once, after choosing evil, we become conscious of the inadequancy of 80 discriptivesour situation. Thus, the fall is at its basic, the transition form from theinsubstantial into the substance. Life as such is neither evil nor stupid; it is more than and more. The Fall is the transition from \"the insubstantials to the substance\" . A subject cannot be split between appearance and materiality. Subject is divided between appearance-to-subject. The subject is divided among appearance and content. The object that subjects are is what Laca calls objetA a, a weird objects which is not just lacking, never completely here, always giving the subject something to look at. That is why subject is nothing but confusion. When subject is seen frontally, it acquires shape only when looking backwardly. There is a gap between reality and transcendence. All three cases have the same gap between ordinary realities and transcendent dimensions. The poet sees beauty in the face of a bush, while the madman misperces a real thing as something else. They all mistake someone for God or devil. These two examples show how subjectivity can be reduced to nothing but failure to be subject. Assuming that subject is passive, subject does not stand on active intervention. Instead, subject is self-reliant.\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how Palpatine's face is transformed when he confronts Anakin. He realizes that his identity as Darth Sildious is now completely debased and that he will be able to return to his former self. This is because of the ironic truth that Christ is not just a Son of God, but a divine being who dies on the Cross. The death also means that Christ has become God. It is precisely through Christ's death that Christ becomes God. If we were to compare Christ to an ordinary commodity, then it would be impossible for us to understand why Christ was so important in the Christian worldview. Instead, we should see him as the product of the excesses of human nature. When Christ dies, there is no need for anything; instead, it is necessary for something to happen. Thus, by killing Christ, we can change our destiny.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses two examples to illustrate his point that the claim that God is evil can be more unsettling. The first example concerns a young woman who becomes a fanatic of the Rapture and begins to practice a new life. She marries a man named Randy and has another daughter, Mary. After six years, they are shot by a crazy man. They go to a desert camping place where they wait until they are taken into Heaven. When they get there, they find out that they are not allowed to take their own lives in order to enter heaven. At the jail, however, things turn out differently: when Mary appears with angels and tells her that she loves God, it turns out that God doesn't really care what she says. He just wants to use human beings to justify himself. This is part of Christian tradition. For example, Nicolas Malebranche points out that even though God didn't exist, Christ would have been happier at the time because he was suffering on the cross. If God did not exists, then no one would have died. But if God did exist, then nothing could be permitted. It is only through knowledge that we can escape from the material world. Gnostics believe that God acts like a cosmic Clown; instead, God acts as an agent of wisdom. Good guys turn out to become good guys. A common joke among these people is that a person who believes he isn't a seed or a farmer is taken to mental institution where doctors convince him that all men are real men. However, once he gets cured, he returns frightened again. There is a bird outside the door that will eat them.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses the example of Christ's seven last words to argue that the ultimate case of his broken vessel is God himself. He contrasts the concept of phallic pleasure with the idea of counterfaction, which means that there is no difference between what is real and what is not. The only difference between these two types of truth is that they are both false; in other words, they are contradictory. This leads him to reject the notion of pious communism as an impossible fantasy because it does not exist at all.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses Hegelian logic to argue that there is no religious dimension in any of the radical political projects. He rejects the notion that religion is simply a secularization of deliverance and Benajmin's notion of \"the weak messiaic force\" of revolution as an act of retroactive redemption from past failures; instead, he contends that it is more than just a mere materialist fantasy. He also discusses the concept of negative theology, which refers to the idea that God cannot be described through positive or negative decisions. The term negative theologies are used to describe the idea where god cannot be explained by any positive or even negative determinations. It is not necessarily scientific materialism, but rather the notion of absolute self-efficacy of reality. This perspective emphasizes the fact that existence is the fullest of the productive processes of life. There is nothing lacking in reality, however, because everything is present with its own self-reversions. Hamlet does not die when he thinks about Claudius praying. He does not kill him when his prayers are answered since he would never strike at anything less than what is right now at that x that makes Cludius king\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator continues his argument against Christianity. He defends the idea that God is in love with one another and that man can be perfect only by sin. This leads to Qutb's concept of human civilization. A society which belongs solely to Allah finds expression in obeying the Divine Law and freeing all people from servitude. The principle of freedom for every person is held true because no one is slave to another. All men have equal rights regardless of their race, color, or nation. If they are not free, they are enslavers to their animal natures. Man is capable of changing his thoughts and actions but cannot decide what place or country he is born to be. Thus it becomes clear that there is no equality between men and women. It is clear that slavery is an example of how humans are oppressed by the marketplace. As such, we should also note that animals do little good when they are civilized.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses the analogy of death to explain his view of Christianity. He believes that God is dead because there is no way for us to live without him. The only living being in Christianity is the son; therefore, we have to turn around the common notion that Christ is God's puppet. This means that Christians cannot be trusted with direct knowledge and unconditional certainty since they are surprised at strange signs of divine intervention. Milner defends the distinction between exactitude and substantiveity by arguing that truth is an agent who speaks through error against the facts itself. For instance, Lacan tells us that the Russian language has three words for truth: \"Itina\" which means \"the simple exactness of reported facts,\" while it means \"pravada\" meaning \"the deeper ethico-politischen truth.\" These words were used during the Cold War as evidence against the murder of Trotsky. They also refer to the fact that the main official Russian daily newspaper was Prvda instead of Istina. It is important to note that these words do not mean exactly the same thing as the actual Russian daily newspapers did when they were written about the cold war. However, one can still see how the term \"theology\" comes from the subject of something beyond human beings.\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator argues that Christians and Muslims cannot be true because they are too primitive to believe. He rejects the notion of belief as an epistemology, which is a form of logical misunderstanding of the world. The solution for religion is tohistoricize all religions as expressions from some transcendent divination. All religions are expressed by the deepest God, dead, unconscious, evil, impotent, stupid. This is what Marx calls \"secular humanism,\" which means that all people have different kinds of desires and fears at different stages of their development. To be a Protestant is the only possible way to be one who does not believe in God himself. If we do not accept God as our supreme being, then religion is no more real than any other religion. Kiergegaard defends the concept of god as the idea that everything is impossible. He says that there is nothing God can do but return to ourselves when we reach the maximum distance between ourselves and the universe. We should not call religion a defense against this kind of experience; it is simply an attempt to defuse the void of self-representation through scientific objectivism. It is not science that erases subjectivity or science that removes subjecthood. Instead, it is the event of Nirvania, which frees us from the limitations of our self as an autonomous agent.\n",
            "In this chapter, Lacan argues that there is no class struggle in the world because there are two distinct classes. He uses examples from Lacan and Alenka to illustrate his point. The class is the exception, not the class with the proper place within society. For example, Lurenzo Chiesa's Not-Tweet Two discusses God as the symbolic God who has three faces: the real God, evil and brutally violent; the imaginary God of Job or Cartesian Malingénie cheating people all. As for Chiesan's reading of Lacan's \" formulas of seduction,\" he neglects the work of Emilia Copjec's book, \"Sex andthe Euthanasia Of Reason.\" Finally, he uses an example from Fritz Lang's Metropolis to argue that the woman of heart is the mediator between labor and capital, the guaranteeof the organic stability over social relations. This line of thought also applies to Marx's theory that humanity poses to itself its own tasks which it can solve.\n",

            "In this chapter, Malabou argues that the subject of self-retrieval is not limited to objects, but rather extends beyond them. She contends that subjects are too objective and cannot be separated from reality because they have a transcendental priori. Kant uses the term epigenesis as an example: epigenesis is \"the encounter of contingent things in experience, who actualize the transcendentally network.\" The subject becomes transcendental when it experiences its own self-inventment. This freedom allows subjectivity to act independently. If we were to enter the realm of the sublime, then we would deprove ourselves into lifeless automation or thinking machines. Hegel defends this idea by saying that we are only at the level where our actions are determined by the logic of pleasure and pain. We are reduced to mere mechanism. It is impossible for us to return to the infinite world through our actions.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses the example of an abstract subject to illustrate how different his personal identity is from that of an ordinary human being. He then proceeds to discuss the concept of decoherance, which refers to \"the gap between material realities and the register of reality in another medium.\" Decoherence theories attempt to explain how things can be tricked into conforming to the laws of nature. The idea that God acts as an agent in the creation of things cannot be explained by the scientific method.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses his dialectical-metaphysical approach to define the notion of disparities. He draws a line between object-oriented thinking and self-conscious behavior by drawing a distinction between them. The difference between the subject and the substance is the division between them: the subject is the object; the substance has its own doing. The subject cannot fully grasp the substantial content of the object because it does not know how to respond to the opposing material reality. This contrasts with Christianity, where man can only attain unity with god through an effort to remove himself from material filh and ascend back to god. Disparity points toward a whole that does not fit together so that the whole appears artificially composite. It is impossible to understand why science and theology do not work together in the same way. Mao writes about women holding up half of Heaven, which means that there is great chaos beneath heaven. Marcel Prouset tells us that when he was talking to his grandmother, she subtracted her voice from the totality of his body. When he saw her, he realized that she was sick and lost in thought. At the philosophical level, truth is at the side of abstract reduction, subjection, and not upon the sideof organic totality\n",
            "In this chapter, Lacan explains how subjectivity can be divided between appearance and the inaccessible content of its being. He uses the example of Bostoridge's novel Winterreise to illustrate his point that subjectivity is not just a matter of appearance but also an object. The object we see as subject is nothing but itself; it is only possible because subjectivity exists in its own self-portrait. This means that subjects are separate from other objects and cannot be separated from their substantial content. For example: A stranger comes to the house and does not want to marry or have children. Because there is no reason for him to leave, he is empty. It is therefore the cause of his departure. Furthermore, since the person who left the house was rejected by his parents, they are not alienated from the real world. Thus, subjectivity has two modes of functioning: one which disturbs harmony with another and one which fills in the gap between them. Since sexual relations are part of human society, there isn't any need for prosthetics. We don't have first intersubjectivities without a prothetic supplement. Therefore, our subject is \"the Other Quaternal Real Thing\" . If we were to think of anything as subjectivity, we wouldn't know what it is until we realize that it doesn't exist at all. Instead, we pass from something to something through a series of passages. From substance to subject becomes a reflective reversional process. Subjectivity is always tearing apart unity. Reason is more important than understanding because it allows us to subsume everything else. As opposed to reasoning, however, Reason is less important than Understanding because it gives us insight into what actually is happening. When we perceive something as abstract, we blind ourselves to its constituent features. That is, we do not understand what the object is really like. What makes sense here is that we view things as abstractions rather than mere notions.\n",
            "In this chapter, Bryant focuses on the idea of how we can construct our own understanding of reality. He begins by saying that it is necessary for us to defend autonomy of objects and substances, not to reduce them to their relations. This means that subject is nothing more than an inaccessible entity. Quenti Meillassouux also discusses facticity with regard to absolute contin-gency. The only way to know what is possible is through experience. It is through factsicity that we can make our way toward the absolute. For example, when we think about something as being part of another thing, it is actually self-withdrawn. When we see something as belonging to another person, we are treated as others rather than ourselves. If we were talking about God, however, we would say that God is opaque to us. Thus, all things are like Lacanian subjects: each object perceives everything as being related to another; there is no direct relation between the object and the other. Each object does not have direct access to another but instead has blind spots. Withdrawing here is the structure of objects, not an accident relation of how they relate to another object. As such, every object is withdrawn from itself. All these points lead to the question of why people do not engage in serious political action. DistitiesBryant gives two examples of communist societies: one where political jokes were really a form of resistance to the ruling ideological system, while another where the majority did not take seriously the ruling ideology. These examples illustrate how socialism fails to produce real change.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses Hegel's concept of experience to explain his failure in speculating on the relationship between subjects and predicates. The subject is the contradiction that forms the central of all things; it is the subject itself that resists its objectification. This contradiction also applies to Freud's idea of the unconscious as the product of dream-work. It is not simply an intention or a prediction, but rather a desire fulfilled by the work of the dreamer. Thus, the laten dream-thoughted becomes the material that the dream worker transforms into \"the manifest dream\"; the only essential thing for dreams is the labor of encodeing/masking the dream thoughts. For example, a manager may be involved in a day-dream because he wants to finance the production of a new machine. But the owner of the factory must depend upon capital to pay for the translation of the wish into the dream language. Therefore, the workers who perform the job are dependent on the capitalist to provide the necessary funds for the creation of the new device.\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how different objects can be represented in relation to one another. He uses an example of observing a dog that does not do anything in the nighttime. The absence of such something can then be used as a source of self-reflection. This is important because it allows us to talk about what we don't see or experience at all. For instance, if there is no penis in the house, then presence can arise only against its background. If there is nothing else in the room, then our presence can also arise against the fact that there is none. Thus, when someone lacks a signifying field, they have to use a symbol that has no meaning. Lévin-Strausses first introduces the concept of mana into his philosophy. Mana is a zero-signifyer, which represents nothing more than \"that floating signifier\" which is the handicap of all fimini thought. It is here that Brandom starts his reading of phenomenological theory with an understanding of experience. Hegel says that when we compare our idea of / object to this thing ourselves, we change our notion and become conscious of what it is. When we alter our notion, however, things are changed. We now know that the stick itself is bent, but instead of being bent, it is actually straight. What changes is the way we perceive the stick for us. Our perception of the stick is altered by our new notion of it. And so on. These three levels of experience are essential for knowledge: 1) we understand the stick; 2) we recognize it as real; and 3) we realize that it is really in itself. So what happens after we discover these contradictions is that we begin to discard them.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses the example of an unfortunate stick as an example of how contradiction can be resolved by thinking about it. He rejects the notion that what is outwardly inconsistent is not the world itself but rather the essence of reason. The difference between objects that appear to be self-conscious and those that are not, he says, is that they do not exist in the same way. For instance, when we see a self-consciously conscious stick, we realize that it is part of the real world because it exists for us. When we see something that is completely self-confident, we know that it means something else. We also learn that there are other kinds of self-contradictions that cannot be resolved through epistemologies. These are called epistimological illusions or inadequacies. Hegel does not reconcile the two sides of reality with each other; instead, if we want to reconcile, we must change our perception of reality so that we can understand it better.\n",

The first level is for the \"ungrounded revolution decision\" that is ultimately supported by its own Audacity; the second is for everything else in the world, including our experience of history and scientific knowledge. He believes that Marxism connects all these features to the idea of revolutionary action. This means that there is no need for any nonknowledge in political decisions. For example, during the French Revolution it was easy to recognize most rational and courageous men who despaired because they did not know what their revolutionary actions would do in terms of continuing the revolution. However, as soon as they realized that they were mistaken, they committed all possible mistakes. They believed that the revolution had nothing to do with reality but only the imaginary mixture from past events and present assessment that is called reality. Thus, instead of understanding the difference between real and reality, they treat the revolution as something that destroys reality.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses Hegel's Conclussion as an example of his opposition to abstract freedom. He rejects the idea that all people are free in the same world because it is impossible to separate them into multiple parts. He believes that these parts should be divided into constituent parts so that each individual can fulfill his or her own role within the totality of society. The most straightforward formula of the Fascist dream is: \"A proper place for everybody, and everyone with his proper place.\" This means that there is no difference between what we see and what we actually see. It also means that every person has a particular role within their society. Thus, Hegel thinks about the relationship between class distinctions and sexual difference. For example, one might have a sexual relationship with a woman who is liberated but does not want to live in a society where women are oppressed by men. Another way to deal with this tension is to use the term \"divine violence,\" which Walter Benjamin used earlier in his book on violence. When he wrote this essay, he called it divine violence, meaning something without any sanction. Now, however, when he talks about class struggle, referring to the fact that justice is possible only through an action of divine violence rather than just generalization, they do not understand how to apply this logic to human actions.\n",

If you want to get rid of your military service, you must do it as if nothing has happened. But if you want something more permanent, you need to break down the old order first. It doesn't matter what kind of revolution you go through; it only matters whether or not you actually change it. For example, if everyone thinks that the world is already dead, then they can just act as though everything has already happened. That way, when things don't work out, they won't be wasting time trying to figure out how to keep them from falling apart. So, there are two kinds of breaks: 1) formal breaks at the beginning and 2) formal breaks after the fact--the first opens up the actual process of change, while the second occurs at the final moment. These two processes are different because they involve both forms of change. The first form takes note of what has already been done, but the second acts take note of all that has already taken place. Everyone who wants to change needs to realize that their whole world is now lost. They also need to register the fact that these changes are already done so that no one ever loses his or her chance to become a better person. Finally, however, even when the battle ends, the loss of the old system becomes effective.\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator discusses some of the most important lines from Schiller's work. He begins with a discussion of how his first book The Robberers was about the danger of unconstrained free will and then proceeds to discuss the theme of friendship, love and political power. It is clear that Schiller wants to create a kind of utopia in which all people are equals under the same roof. This utopia is called Don Carlos, but it is actually more like a comedy than a tragedy.\n",
            "In this paper, Badiou addresses the mistake of social violence as a mere means to achieve some end. He rejects the notion that violence serves an end only when it is related as merely a means for reaching an end. The example of the Paris suburb protests in April and May of 2005 illustrates his point that there is no real hope of a positive utopian vision among the people who took part in these events. They were simply motivated by their own desire to be free from the oppressive conditions they lived in. There was no hermeneutic message or message hidden within these outburts; rather, they were what Lacan calls \"a passage a l' acte\" . It is difficult to understand why such violent strations are not just unjust, but also terrifying. A Leftist friend at the university tells him how his son came to be educated near a black high school with a large majority of black children. This dilemma cannot be resolved at this level because the very difference between private interest and world justice bears witnesses to a position which has to been overcome. Badioou defends the concept of dialectical materialism against historical materialism. He believes that dialectics can root into social practices and political struggle.\n",
            "In this chapter, Badiou focuses on the idea of envy. He rejects the notion that there will always be envy in capitalist society because it is replaced by pleasure in others' pleasures. He uses Lacan's definition of human desire as an example: \"human desire is always desired of the Other.\" This means that we have to abandon our idealistic view of equality and move toward something more just. The point of the possible is not to be raised beyond the very limit of equality. It is impossible for capitalism to advocate democratic equality, which is undermined through the actualization of its goals. For Marx, equality was the only form of inequality; his goal was to move beyond the absolute limit of unity. There are other contradictions inherent in the concept of equality, such as the fact that people vote wrongly or demand excessive state regulations. These contradictions lead us to think about the international free market. A few years ago, Mali had been described as a place where the European Union has become the main culprit of the country's poverty. If you want to abolish excessive state regulation, simply stick to your self-referential rules about free markets. Another argument against this type of militaryization is that it can only be used for a brief period of transition. However, even if one accepts the need for militarization, it cannot be imagined along those lines.\n",

Scenes from happy lives are the focus of this chapter. In Not I, the audience is introduced to a woman who has been suffering for many years. She tells how she came to be in such a state and how she believes God will punish her for her suffering.\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how we can get to know people more easily when we don't even know who they really are. He uses Winnicotes theory that children should be alone in their mothers' presence because there is something deeply important for them to experience before they become lovers. This means that once they have been married, they must find a way to be alone with other people without being impeccably attached to them. For example, one day after colonoscopies, the doctor offers the UM to watch some old classic movies together. The UM is surprised at the offer and wonders what he will do with it. He has recently undergone colonoscoscopy and gets a small recording of his entire colonic through the whole length of his colon. It turns out that these things are very different from evolution and revolution. Revolution is opposed to evolution, which is like evolution: everything changes within the space of change while in an evolution anything moves somewhere else. There is also a deeper irony in this fact that revolution comes to mean radical change. When things return to reality, nothing changes; instead, nothing stays the same. We see two examples of this shift in the subject: Shakespeare's Richard II and Not I A. These cases show that the subject doesn't exist as it was originally supposed to be. Instead, it is \"the retroactive effect\" of its failure. If you want to know why someone is talking about you, you need to read the passages from Act 2, Scene 6, where Corneille describes the object cause of desire. What does the object make us? Why am I saying I am my beloved? What remain of me unless the symbolic title is taken away From me? How is I what I Am? What remains Of me if not the symbolic name I am? O that I had no name... But 'tisus usurp' d! Alack the heavy days That I haveworn so many winter-out And know not yet what name to ask myself. O thatI were a joke king of Snow, Standing before Bolingbrokes, To melt himself away in water drops. At the time of rebellion in 1381, Richard II was only fourteen years old. He met up with twenty thousand peasant rebels on Smithfield near London and shouted that he would be his chief and captain. After the rebels died, Richard\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator discusses the various forms of literature that confront and sublimate abjectness. The most famous is Céline's \"long voyage to the Bottom of the Night,\" in which he describes the night as the night of an abject. He also warns against any attempt to escape from the patriarchical order by returning to the pre-Protectional female rhythm of drives. This is because it leads us into anti-Samitism. For example, three decades ago German nationalist leaders printed an advertisement with the slogan: Kärnten bleiben deutsch. These words were used on newspapers throughout Austria during the 1897-1897 campaign against the Slovene Threat. Since these people did not want to be associated with anything other than the word for Beetle, Freud wrote up a series of references to the meaning of Käfer when he was attempting to catch his first black beeletle at age ten. When he heard this phrase, he laughed loudly and explained that the meaning had come from being unable or unable to create one's mind. Thus, we can see how Kristeva uses the term \"abjection\" to refer to all kinds of situations. She does not understand what she calls the symbolic order; she thinks only of the abjection itself. Her definition of the symbolic order comes from her understanding of the semiotic. She believes that every call to return back to the Judeo Christian Compound has repressed something else within it. It is therefore necessary for the Jew to avoid the conflict between working class/capital and the separation between the symbolic and real.\n",
            "In the last pause of the play, the speaker shifts from being melancholy to being full of content. The audience realizes that this is the final shift in the play and wonders what it means. It turns out that Beckettian readers have been reading the play as if it were an epigraph for their own experience with God. They are also confused by the shifting between the Mouth and the Other. This shift seems to signal a change in the character of the speaker: she becomes more like herself instead of being something else. She does not know what to do now that she has no idea what to say. Finally, however, she can assume her word.\n",

            "In this chapter, the narrator discusses some of the more recent developments in the Left-Leaning movement in the South. He uses examples from several books to illustrate his point that women are not necessarily superior to men in terms of their virtues. For example, David Fincher's seven-person murderer is shot by Mills because Doe murdered his pregnant wife. Mills's sin is jealous; Doe envies Mills for being happy with his family life and therefore does not want to kill him. The woman's death doesn't fit the story: she committed nothing sin, she was killed just to wake up uncontrollably anger in Millses. This makes the audience wonder why John Doe de Capitate Mills after all.\n",

            "In this chapter, the narrator argues that Christians and Muslims cannot be true because they are too primitive to believe. He rejects the notion of belief as an epistemology, which is a form of logical misunderstanding of the world. The solution for religion is tohistoricize all religions as expressions from some transcendent divination. All religions are expressed by the deepest God, dead, unconscious, evil, impotent, stupid. This is what Marx calls \"secular humanism,\" which means that all people have different kinds of desires and fears at different stages of their development. To be a Protestant is the only possible way to be one who does not believe in God himself. If we do not accept God as our supreme being, then religion is no more real than any other religion. Kiergegaard defends the concept of god as the idea that everything is impossible. He says that there is nothing God can do but return to ourselves when we reach the maximum distance between ourselves and the universe. We should not call religion a defense against this kind of experience; it is simply an attempt to defuse the void of self-representation through scientific objectivism. It is not science that erases subjectivity or science that removes subjecthood. Instead, it is the event of Nirvania, which frees us from the limitations of our self as an autonomous agent.\n",

            "In this chapter, the narrator argues that lack and excess are opposites. The difference is that we don't get first an object which is then filled in by something else. This means that language is nothing but \"a reply to...missing signifier\" . Translation: language is not just composed of signsi-flames, but it also has its own obstacles. It doesn't matter whether there is or not a subject with a missing signer. There is no sexual difference between men and women because they are subjectivated in two ways. For example, one can say man and woman are One and the other cannot exist because God does not exist. If we were to talk about what Man and Women mean, they wouldn't be One and another. But Lacan wants us to think that there is neither god nor sexual relationship. He says that both kinds of existence have their own limitations. A God exists because there must be a God; otherwise, our ordinary world would be empty without God. So, for instance, there is none of the religious idealist notions that Lacan believes. Lorenzochiesa interprets these contradictions as a result of Lacan's reading of passages from his seminar. Chiesesa reads some passages like those from Lacan himself. They all point to the discontinuity between biological life and the symbolic. These are examples of how Lacan sees the gap between the symbolic order and the real.\n",

            "In this chapter, Hegel focuses on the concept of self-reversal and how it can be used to explain what is going on in the world. He uses examples from the classical literature as an example. A subject cannot achieve its full identity when it does not fully grasp the substantial content of the object being observed. The believer's experience of becoming abandoned by God becomes a gap between God and himself that separates him from God. Pippin also discusses the idea of absolute reflection, which means that everything is always relative to itself but only externally. Hegelian terms are absoluter Gegensetzen, or counterpunch, which refers to the effect of losing something upon itself. This implies that we do not lose our own sense of ourselves because there is no way for us to get rid of these things. We have no access to the profound presubjectative Real, so we cannot get rid off it. Absoluter Ausgangsstoß stands for the coincidence of the opposings in the action. What is found only come to be until being left behind is the result of its own absence. It is the retroactivity of its loss. Self-consciousness is one of the most important subjects in psychoanalysis. Lacan de-substantizes the unconscious into the more modern field of subjectivity. He considers the state as the self-consciously ethical substance of a person.\n",

            "In this chapter, the UM uses the analogy of a dog as an example of how Hegelian universality can be applied to human beings. He says that there are always only one species or subspecies that functions like \"a filler\" and that it is impossible to make such an affirmation anti-hegelian. He also discusses the concept of concrete universality, which means that all things exist under the same conditions. The idea of concrete universalization comes from Hegel's notion of universality in relation to other people. For instance, Ambedkar believes that there will be outcasts in India because of the social hierarchy. This contradiction arises from the fact that Hinduism did not have a system for dealing with untouchables. It was just a question about the foundation of religion. Although both men respect each other, their differences are insurmountably different. They argue that the solution to the problem by returning to the original noncorruptible system is more effective than abolishing the whole system. If one wants to break out into the children of god, it isn't enough to remove the castes from society. But if you want to change the status of humanity, it doesn't matter what kind of person you are. There are two kinds of features that are more essential: labor and speech. These are those that we use to represent our immanent desires. We don't necessarily focus on these features; they are simply shared by others. Thus, when we say that speech is more essential, we mean that it makes us communicate with others. When we say man is the animal who clips its nails, we are talking about something else. That is why many people believe that sexuality is nothing but a form of reproduction. Freud sees this as the beginning of metaphysical activity. Christianity does not view sexuality as anything specific to humans since it competes with spirituality. Christianism thinks that sexual desire is the fundamental step toward the Absolute Good. Therefore, Christians do not consider sexuality to be any sort of evil. Instead, they look at it as the ultimate step towards the absolute Good. A modern individual experiences himself as his own personal experience. He has no connection to the particular circumstances of his life. He feels self-aware of the limitations of class distinctions and cannot judge whether justice is right or wrong.\n",
            "In this chapter, Anderson argues that Hegel's idealism is the only thing that can be broken out of the idealist dialectical process. He rejects the notion of subjectivity as an absolute idea; instead, he sees the subjectivity emerges through its self-adoptation. This means that Anderson does not believe in Hegel and his critics because they attack him as a \"straw man\" who has nothing to do with the actual content of his work. Anderson also dismisses the use of science as the main scientific reference since it is important to understand how human beings are created and how they relate to one another. He believes that there must be absential features in the world that cannot be explained by physical terms. The absence of these features is what Deacon refers to in Incomplete Nature.\n",
            "The narrator uses the example of the 1920s collectivation of land as an example of Hegel's immobilism. He says that everything is already there, and that this immanent contradictory action is what Lebrunch calls \"immobilisment.\" This is why Lebrun calls it immobilisticm: things become what their always-always were, not what they are today, but what they always have been. In order for these things to really change, they first have to accept that they exist in the past. For example, when a bell Button is connected to another bomb, one can only press it with the intent of doing something important. When he presses it, however, his actions are nothing more than mere impulses. If he wants to visit someone else, he does not need to be responsible for the consequences; he just needs to act on behalf of the common good. Hegelian theory emphasizes the unity of creation and finding within individuals engaged in specific actions. Thus, each individual acts according to his or her own desires and needs. There is absolutely no higher idea which governs the relationship between the initial goal and its transformation through corrections. It is impossible to reconcile objective normative structure with actuality because all people engage in them. Therefore, alienation exists only through the interaction of individuals who are involved in those structures.\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how Hegel's theory of self-reflection works in relation to his theory of reason. He uses an analogy of earthquakes to illustrate how the concept of the unconscious can be used to describe the inner turmoil that characterizes all human beings. This is because the unconscious is not necessarily dominated by the external world, but rather its epicentre: the \"deep hypocentre\" of human experience. For example, George Kaplan has a name attached to him as a spy for the CIA. The idea of having a secret identity makes him vulnerable to foreigners and other dangers. Art and religion have a long history reaching down into Hegelian territory, but they are still separate from one another. Hegel believes that art cannot exist without the spirit; it must also exist within itself.\n",

He uses an analogy to illustrate his point: real is not part-of-reality but a virtual thing that cannot actually be seen or experienced. It is impossible for anything to exist because it is immobilized by historical forces, such as class struggle and sexual antagonism. The only way to achieve this illusion is to use symbolic meaning. This means that we can see things in terms of other people rather than with our own perceptions. Wolstonecraft then discusses the concept of stasi, which refers to stability and immobility. A person who resists something will always have the power to resist something else. For example, when a subject protests against society, it opens up the possibility of accessing the unconscious.\n",

            "Hegel's greatest failure in art is not that he can see the infinite goal already realized. The illusion of reconciliation is ultimately the reconciliation with failure itself. Pippin thinks this is what modern artists like Manet, Cezanne, and Picasso all do. In fact, they indicate alienation from society as individuals lack proper place within it. They are forced to position themselves as an independent subject without any means of identity or projecting into the artwork. This creates a sense of disorientation among the spectators. For example, in his Luncheon On the grass, he describes two naked women engaged in postcoital cleaning. Their nakedness indicates tender shame while the naked woman sits on the grass looking but not seeing. All the social divisions invade the painting; there is no source of light inside the painting. It is also apparent that the ugly gaze is one of the most powerful features of art. Art makes every shape in each member some specific activity and partial emotions. But for instance, when we look at the thousand-eyed Argus by Holbein, our eyes signal castration. When we stare at the image of thousands of eyes, however, our soul becomes visible. We cannot understand why many eyes are present in such a picture. If we ask why these eyes are so important, Freudian philosophers say that they are only used to signal castingration of the one. And then again, because of class distinctions, people return in multiplicity. There is nothing new about the Black Athena thesis.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses Hegel's metaphors to explain how fear and sopsis can be used to create ideals. The UM also discusses the possibility of art after the death of art, as it is comical in its portrayal of everyday life. For example, one might imagine a Muslim being mocked for his deformity while another imagines a corpse being slit open by a spider. This would lead to comedy, since there is no moral conflict between the two worlds.\n",
            "In this book, Slavj ek offers his own interpretation of Hegel's philosophy. He uses the metaphor of a giant mole as an example. He considers that the mole represents the world spirit in laying its ground for enlightenment. The idea of rhizomes is also used as an analogy to the concept of Kraken, which awakens when it disturbs the smooth surfaces of history. This book addresses three main areas: onlogical, aesthetic and theological. It begins with a description of the different positions of disparity within the classical triumviral model of truth, beauty, and goodness. At the philosophical level, there is a brutal struggle between class distinctions and scientific reason.\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how Hegelian philosophy has changed over the last century. The idea of self-consciousness in sculptures is absent from most works because they do not express the inner self as it is expressed in the form of the eye. Instead, these works are more like an expression of spirituality than anything else. For example, Christ's body was distorted by his own appearance, making him visible to the world as a human being. Both Judasm and Christianity believe that God lives in \"an unrepresentible realm,\" separated from humans by an absolute gap between them. From the sublime to the monstaus, Rosenkrrenz introduces the concept of the ugly as an object of aesthetic art. He uses the term \"ugliness\" to refer to the fact that something can be ugly even though it is beautiful. This means that one can have both good and bad qualities at the same time.\n",
            "In this chapter, Adam Phillips discusses Hegel's philosophy of mind and his theory of cubism. He uses the example of a painting as an example to illustrate how one can interpret the ugly in a way that makes the object of the painting appear ugly. The author also uses the analogy between cubicism and Argus to demonstrate how it is possible to view the world from multiple points of view. For example, Rosenkrtanz seems to ignore Hegel when he thinks about the \"ugliness\" of the human body. This contrasts with the idea of the idealized person who has no bodily organs. As for the self-preoccupied individual, Deleuze remains within the bounds of the aristocratic phronesi. He does not advocate transgression, but rather encourages us to live according to our desires.\n",

            "The narrator continues his argument against the concept of subjectivity in this chapter. He says that subjectivity is for itself only when its singularity becomes \"for itself\" and not external to anything else. Badiou, however, opposes human life because it is oriented towards serving the goods. In contrast, Lacan's philosophy of death drives human beings toward an innermost level of existence. This leads him to consider immortality as a form of eternality which can be destroyed by excessive enjoyment. For example, one can imagine two children who are constantly acting evilly against respected authorities until they both fall onto the floor and form a shapes of the two boy. Adornon was right about when he said that when one encountered a truly Evil person, it would be difficult to imagine how this person could die. We all will die, but there is no reason why we cannot escape from our own mortality. Lacan uses the example of hungry animals to illustrate his theory of erotic awareness. When hunger is expressed through eating, food is associated with pleasure. Eating also serves to convey the meaning of desire. It is important to note that lacan doesn't directly address materialism; instead, he emphasizes the importance of the relationship between desire and death. Thus, if someone wants to risk everything for his or her desires, then what does he really want? If something causes our desire simply because it involves danger and sacrifice, then perhaps we should call this desire erootic.\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how we are ashamed of our innermost self-sacrifice because it comes out from our \"interior\" . He says that animals do not have any problem with their outermost intimacy; they just don't have one. The only problem with life is that it gets destroyed by the external world. It becomes inorganic and loses its vitality. Life is disgusting at the way it got there. There are some really sublime moments in Ridley Scotsman's Alienrection: One of the first is when Ripley goes to the laboratory room where the aborted versions of herself are on display. She sees them but doesn't get rid of them. The second is when she finds a piece of paper on the floor next to her body. This is like a message from the other scene. Hitchcock takes great pleasure in cleaning the bathroom after his work. He thinks about how perfect an act can be for evil purposes. He also considers how morally inappropriate it is for Hegelian art to claim that it is beautiful. Hegel does not yet understand the ways in which abstract art works.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses the analogy of transcendentality to argue that everything in the world is always overdeterminated. He rejects the idea of overdeterminations and believes that every subject can only be overdetermine by its relation to reality. The UM also defends the notion of an onticity as opposed to an ontology because it does not involve self-experimentation but rather the \"inhuman\" core of what he calls negativeity, death drives, and otherontological difference. This means that humans are excluded from all kinds of social positions; they do not fit into the universal form of human being. It is therefore important to distinguish between premodern Cartesian subjects and antihumanist subjects. Kant was the first philosopher against humanism who rejected both terms: the void of negativity and the person. For example, Heidegger's definition of being human implies that we cannot be fully human until we have our own individual selves. If we take this limitation or obstacle away, we lose ourselves. Berardi points out that the next task of science will be about harnessing the power of the brain. Brain activity is going to play a big role in the future.\n",
            "Boulter argues that the whole of the Triumvirate is about getting rid of subjects. The subjectivity is no longer an object, but only partially alive. It is timeless. Scenes from happy lives are the focus of this chapter. In Not I, the audience is introduced to a woman who has been suffering for many years. She tells how she came to be in such a state and how she believes God will punish her for her suffering.\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how people find pleasure in the pain they are suffering. He uses a metaphor to illustrate this point: when someone is suffering, it is because of something else going on around them. When someone is happy, it means that something else is going on outside of them, which makes it impossible for them to find pleasure elsewhere. This is what Schuster calls \"the gap between desire and drive\" . It is not an unsolved problem, but a basic insight into the structure of human psychology. Deleuze sees things as nothing more than organs without bodies and subject-objects together. The difference between delusions and drives is that there is no subject or object at the beginning of the process. Subject-object distinction takes place before subject-subject distinction. Passive sublimation involves subjectivizing without subject. Drive emerges from failure into success. Lacan's approach here is passive synthesis with subject-enterprising intensities. For Delesuze, everything starts withorgans without body; the chaos multiplicity of subjects without bodies. They form the primordial transient process of passive creation out of which topic gradually emerges by active synthesis\n",
            "In this chapter, Lacan argues that the innermost drive of human beings is not felt as an internal compulsion but rather as a external force. He rejects the notion that life is self-efident and self-conscious; instead, it is a commandments and duty. The author believes that humans are inherently connected to the world through their actions. Life is governed by superegos, which operate beyond the pleasure principles. This drives them to live according to the laws of the universe: death drives people toward pain and suffering. Sade does not deny any metaphysical Moralism, but only acknowledges the cost one has to bear for it. His aim is to deconstruct sexuality so that it can become a mechanical exercise. As such, he uses the example of a hero sleeping with his bride before she marries him. If he wants to commit suicide, then he must do something that violates the prohibition against premarital sexual sex. But if he desires to commit murder, then there is no reason why he should act upon his desire. Instead, based on moral law, what we call \"passion\" is strictly sensue ethical. For example, if you want to kill a young woman because she is pregnant, then you have to do it without hurting her feelings. So, even if someone dies from clicto or dectomy, they will still be alive.\n",
            "In this chapter, the UM uses Hegelian metaphors to explain his own view of death drives. He says that in order to deny the existence of the other, the sadist despises death drive. This is because it splits subjectivity from within and makes it impossible for him to devote himself to its destructive fantasies. The only way to avoid such a separation is to free an act as its own self-interest. Malabu points out that Hegelius does not understand the negative aspect of death drive; rather, she sees it as the result of \"the pure form of death driven\" . She thinks that death drives people into a false sense of self-realization. When we destroy our subjects, they become nothing but empty forms of subjectivity which erase all their substantial content. Death drives us toward immortality.\n",

            "In this chapter, the narrator discusses Don Carlos's situation. After the rebellion, the King survives, but as an insurmountable broken man. He has no authority to make formal decisions and is therefore forced to send for his Grand Inquistior, who knows all about the murder of Posa. The Grand Inqusitor answers Philip's questions with complete knowledge. When the King decides that it is time for him to kill Poa, the Great Inquistor does not just approve of the decision but also leaves some servants to do the dirty job. This contrasts with God who asked the Holy Spirit to give Christ permission to be sacrificed on the cross. Assuming that the death of one's only son is similar to God's request to redeem humanity, we can see why the King doesn't know what to do when he wants to justify the killing of his own son. Instead, he leaves other servants behind to do \"the dirty job\" which cannot be publicly admitted publicly. For instance, Queen Elizabeth II was pressured to agree to Mary Stuart's execution by her ministers because she did not wish to publicly assume responsibility for the crime. She refused to answer their plea without answering them. If they were my true faithfulservants, do this crimes for me; kill her without forcing me to responsible for her dead body. A more radical level of ignorance is required: at the moment of Madness when one chooses to act...one has to reduce it to merely gesture. This means that bureaucracies try to avoid making final decisions. It is impossible for a foreign student to get a certificat de bonne-vous et moteurs in Switzerland since no one can get the certificate. On another level, the same problem arises in the Stalinism system. Because there is no guarantee of the final outcome, the critics want an act without any guarantee. They want an Act Without Risk. Milner uses the example of a revolutionary leader who does not know how to react to the revolutionary movement.\n",
            "The narrator tells us that Schiller is the poet of free will. He rejects two modes of freedom: destructive revol - triumvir freedom and the mechanical chaos of unorganized market relations. In this way, he sees power as being split into two parts: on one side, pure blind knowledge; and on another, a friend like us who can only engage in genuine friendship. This means that there are two sides to the same process. On one hand, people have no choice but to pursue their own egotistical goals. On the other hand, they do not want to be alienated by an enemy who cannot engage in real friendship. These two kinds of freedom are rejected by the art of political aestheticization. For example, we know that symbolic casting is the price for exercise of power because it introduces a difference between what we immediately are and the function we exercise. If we put on a mask of power, then we become part of the world. We don't just drop our masks or costumes, we also reveal ourselves as \"tribulations of a lady-hypena\" .\n",
            "In this chapter, the narrator explains how bureaucracies work. He describes two scenes in which a hero loses his plumbing and goes to the state repair service to get help. After the sheote is done, he sends a message for an official repair service but instead of doing the job, it takes him directly to the customer. The ultimate crime in any bureaucratic system is to simply do the job that one is expected to do. This cycle of repro creates space for the pleasure of being wasted. At the level of utilitarianism, there are many tasks that need to be accomplished; however, these tasks are not necessarily performed efficiently because they are caught in the circularity of repetition. A good bureaucrat always gets caught up in this cycle of repeating things, creating problems, and making people unhappy. For example, Martel uses the example of black slaves who recognized themselves as human rights subjects during the French Revolution. They misunderstood the point, believing that their own individual rights were intended only by whitemen of property. However, when the situation in Haiti was so strong that it could no longer be understood within its framework, the Bolshevs and Hitler adopted different versions of the communist movement. These new versions included economic crises, moral disintégration, and other nonideological disturbances. Thus, all these external perturbations had to be interpreted through an ideological frame. If we can imagine ideology as autopoetic systems, such as Russia in 1917, then what we can see from the outside world is nothing but \"the excess of theIn-itself\" . We cannot see what we don't see. Because information is predicated on prior distinctions that allow events to take on value, it follow that systems have blind spots. It follows that reality is what you do not perceive when you perceive it.\n",

Time is also connected to musical harmony; it is in this way that Richard can identify with the music and become something else. This shift towards the final line comes from the theme of love. The meaning of the word \"sign of love\" has to be explained in Lacanian terms. It is not scientific knowledge but rather the truth of what lies behind the speaker's back. In fact, Lacan says, there is no sexual relation between the subject and the analyst. The only difference between the two reals is that Beckt cuts down on the richness of the language while Joyce cuts down all the riches of the text.\n",

The theme of Ivan is also used in this essay as an example of how abstract forms can be evoked by atonal music. In particular, Carnaval, a work by Robert Schumann, has twenty-one parts that are not performed effectively. These sections are fragmentary and do not correspond to the actual content of the piece. This is because they are not composed of musical elements but are rather fragments of sound from different sources. At this point, we realize that the meaning of these fragments is not yet clear; it is just a way of thinking about the immanent world of experience.\n",

The other song is about an old man who was afraid of horses because his father cut off his small penis. It is also related to Freud's child, Hans, who had a fear of horses.

            "In this chapter, Lacan argues that the idea of universal man is only partially supported by the fact that no particular man resists the mythic image of the non castrated father. He also contends that men do not have an adequate understanding of their father because they are too weak to understand it from the point of view of his own self-interest. The difference between these two readings is that each man has a gap in relation to the universal man. For example, one man cannot be a public servant while another can be devoted to a corrupt pervert. This means that there is no way for women to keep both dimensions apart and still maintain her private virtues. It is therefore easier for men to sustain such a relationship through the universal symbolism of Man. Finally, Chiesesa points out that sexuality is increasingly reduced to partial objects. These objects allow us to enjoy pleasure more easily than we could ever want.\n",
            "In this chapter, Lacan continues his argument against omnipotance. He uses the example of a child who is dependent on her mother because she cannot yet understand why she decides to do what she does. The child can only experience her as \"an omni-potent agent\" and not as an agent of God. This makes Lacan argue that there is no other beyond the Other in the world. It is impossible for us to deny it but to assert its existence without an agent. For example, Lubitsch uses the analogy of coffee without milk to explain how we can make the same coffee without cream. If we were to say that we have one cup of coffee with cream, then we would have served it without milk. But when we say that they have one without cream, we are saying that we don't have one. Thus, we pass from the point where we get a single negation into the factual statements: We have no plain coffee without any cream; so can it become a coffeewithout milk. At the level of our understanding, we see that we could change the past by making the plain coffee go without cream or milk instead of having it. This means that we can alter the counterfaction between ourselves and the white liberal system. When we say something like, \"I would have serve you coffee without my cream,\" we mean that we wouldn't be able to change the previous statement about whether we have cream or nothing else. That is, we lose the meaning of what we actually have. What we miss out on is part of our identity. So perhaps we should define a rich life along these lines.\n",

            "In this chapter, Bryant focuses on the idea of how we can construct our own understanding of reality. He begins by saying that it is necessary for us to defend autonomy of objects and substances, not to reduce them to their relations. This means that subject is nothing more than an inaccessible entity. Quenti Meillassouux also discusses facticity with regard to absolute contin-gency. The only way to know what is possible is through experience. It is through factsicity that we can make our way toward the absolute. For example, when we think about something as being part of another thing, it is actually self-withdrawn. When we see something as belonging to another person, we are treated as others rather than ourselves. If we were talking about God, however, we would say that God is opaque to us. Thus, all things are like Lacanian subjects: each object perceives everything as being related to another; there is no direct relation between the object and the other. Each object does not have direct access to another but instead has blind spots. Withdrawing here is the structure of objects, not an accident relation of how they relate to another object. As such, every object is withdrawn from itself. All these points lead to the question of why people do not engage in serious political action. DistitiesBryant gives two examples of communist societies: one where political jokes were really a form of resistance to the ruling ideological system, while another where the majority did not take seriously the ruling ideology. These examples illustrate how socialism fails to produce real change.\n",

She contends that subjects are too objective and cannot be separated from reality because they have a transcendental priori. Kant uses the term epigenesis as an example: epigenesis is \"the encounter of contingent things in experience, who actualize the transcendentally network.\" The subject becomes transcendental when it experiences its own self-inventment. This freedom allows subjectivity to act independently. If we were to enter the realm of the sublime, then we would deprove ourselves into lifeless automation or thinking machines. Hegel defends this idea by saying that we are only at the level where our actions are determined by the logic of pleasure and pain. We are reduced to mere mechanism. It is impossible for us to return to the infinite world through our actions.\n",

            "In this chapter, the author focuses on two things: 1) Heidegger's criticism of the German Empire is not about the actual existence of the Nazism; and 2) While there are still some reservations about the Jewish community, Heideger doesn't deny it. Instead, he criticizes the idea that the Jews should be exiled from Europe because they have no place in the world. The first thing to do is to reject primitive biological racism. This isn't just an example of how people can live without being oppressed by society. It's also a way for men to get into their own power through rationality and calculation. So, basically, the Jews were killed by industrialization. They didn't really want to go around killing other people, but they wanted to fight against what was going on inside them. And so they did. Now we need to look back at Hedegger as a philosopher who has been very influential in the twentieth century. We don't know whether his ideas are actually part of the project called Enlightenments or something else. If you're looking for more information on why Hegegger thinks so, let's start with Friedrich Schiller's famous poem, \"The Song Of the Bell,\" which begins with a metaphor about a family where a man goes out and works and takes risks. But when he gets too far away from his wife, she starts to lose her loyalty. She becomes a hyennea.\n",
            "The narrator uses the example of Freud to explain how his rejection of an \"inassimilably joussance\" can lead to barbarism, which is what causes people to reject their own identities. In this way, Lacan sees himself as a group of people who reject the other's jibes. He does not know who or why he is, but he recognizes himself among others who have rejected it. This makes him defend himself against anti-Jewism. For example, in 1931, Adolph Hitler said that they had to kill the Jewish leader within us. Because Jews are the object of the Gentlelies, and because they are so flexible, they need the Jew in order to keep their identity. Anti-Racialism is always historical phenomena, even if its internal form changes with each historical rupture. As for Kristeva's theory of semiotics, she says that there is no more primordial phenomenon than the symbolic. She also notes that Catherine Malalbou'sontology of accident is a secondary effect on the symbolic field; it brings negativeness to its extreme when it destroys the meaning of the subject's psychic life. A materialist view of humanity would take into account all external threats, from volcanoes to earthquakes. But here we go back to Dickens: he was a young man who dreamed about his own future. He lived in London where he could think of nothing but battlefields. His dreams were like those of a child who died at Charingcross. He saw these places as scenes of his own fantasies.\n",

            "In this chapter, Wollstonecraft focuses on the Carbon Liberations Front and asks whether it is possible for humans to be alienated from shared life. Hegel responds that there are two kinds of alienation: first, we can see how difficult it is to reduce the complexity of an object to the \"essential\"; and second, we cannot understand science because it is not dependent on consciousness. The latter is true, however, because science happens in History, constrained with forms of social order. It is only through high theory that we get down to the lowest level of human experience. This means that science does not depend on human consciousness, but rather its ability to perceive the real outside of our normal reality. Morton introduces the concept of interobjective hyperobjects, which are objects that are distributed throughout time and space. These objects are phased, meaning they do not exist in any particular place or time. They become more substantial when they are seen in relation to other objects. Thus, these objects are as threat to organic matter as they are against human beings. There is also a paradox inherent in anthropocentene: society became aware of self- limitation when it became strong enough to influence the balance of all life on earth\n",
            "In this chapter, Spinoza argues that the only way to understand human beings is through their lack of knowledge. He rejects the notion that we should use our ignorance to create morality and injunctions. Lacan emphasizes the From Human to Posthuman Man 21 deontic dimension of being himself. The difference between reality and the world is not just an ontological difference; it also exists as part of the illusion imagined by the master who delivers the message. It is here that we find ontological difference. This difference between the highest or true being and its second shadows is offuscatated by the differences between the supreme being and his secondary shadows: what was going to happen if you were heard what I are ordering you. We can now see two opposing tendencies within this approach towards overcoming humanism and Transhumanism. Posthumanists believe that science and technology will lead us into a posthumanistic mode of being where we will be unable to relate to the animal kingdom. These two opposed tendencies exist within this orientation toward overcoming humanity. PostHumanists argue that humans are one of the animals on Earth, but they do not refer to the transhumanist movement which has been taking place since the beginning of the twentieth century. Biogenetics have become popular among these anti-humanist groups because it dissolves frontiers between men and animals on one side and between humans and machine on the other\n",

This is because of the ironic truth that Christ is not just a Son of God, but a divine being who dies on the Cross. The death also means that Christ has become God. It is precisely through Christ's death that Christ becomes God. If we were to compare Christ to an ordinary commodity, then it would be impossible for us to understand why Christ was so important in the Christian worldview.

            "The UM uses Hegelian logic to argue that there is no religious dimension in any of the radical political projects. He first discusses the concept of negative theology, which refers to the idea that God cannot be described through positive or negative decisions. This perspective emphasizes the fact that existence is the fullest of the productive processes of life. There is nothing lacking in reality, however, because everything is present with its own self-reversions. The term \"negative theology\" is used to describe the idea where god cannot be explained by any positive or even negative determinations. It is not necessarily scientific materialism, but rather the notion of absolute self-efficacy of reality. This leads to Qutb's concept of human civilization. A society which belongs solely to Allah finds expression in obeying the Divine Law and freeing all people from servitude. The principle of freedom for every person is held true because no one slavery exists within this system.. Thus it becomes clear that there is no equality between men and women according to Islamic law . In this chapter,the narrator continues his argument against Christianity. He defends the idea that God is in love with one another and that man can be perfect only by sin .This means that Christians cannot be trusted with direct knowledge and unconditional certainty since they are surprised at strange signs r divine intervention such as when Trotsky was murdered . Milner argues that truth is an agent who speaks through error against facts themselves For instance, Lacan tells us that different words for truth exist:\"Itina\" which means \"the simple exactness reported facts,\" while it means \"pravda\" meaning \"the deeper ethico-politischen truth.\" These words were during Cold War as evidence against murder Andrei Tsyorganovski Kierkegaard defends concept 'god'as idea everything impossible .He says nothing god do except return ourselves we reach maximum distance between ourselves universes We should not call religion defense against experience simply attempt defuse void self-representation through scientismobjectivism Science does erase subjectivity instead event nirvana ,which frees limitations our selves autonomousagent\n",

He uses examples from the classical literature as an example. A subject cannot achieve its full identity when it does not fully grasp the substantial content of the object being observed. The believer's experience of becoming abandoned by God becomes a gap between God and himself that separates him from God. Pippin also discusses the idea of absolute reflection, which means that everything is always relative to itself but only externally. Hegelian terms are absoluter Gegensetzen, or counterpunch, which refers to the effect of losing something upon itself. This implies that we do not lose our own sense of ourselves because there is no way for us to get rid of these things. We have no access to the profound presubjectative Real, so we cannot get rid off it. Absoluter Ausgangsstoß stands for the coincidence of the opposings in the action. What is found only come to be until being left behind is result of its own absence. It is retroactivity if its loss.
